BACKGROUND:
The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), Directorate for Analysis (DI), Analytic Development Office (ADO) – as of 1 October 2022: Analytic Innovation Office (AIO) - leads DIA and Defense Intelligence All-Source Analysis Enterprise (DIAAE) efforts to identify, create, sustain, and promote the current and future personnel talent, tradecraft, training, and analytic tools to accomplish the Agency mission of delivering decision advantage on foreign military capabilities and operating environments to warfighters and policy makers. As the DI delves deeper into leveraging technology and implementing quantitative approaches to all-source analysis, tradecraft, methods, and quality practices must evolve in parallel. This effort ensures that the analytic processes and tradecraft behind advanced analytic methods are appropriately reviewed, instantiated, and documented.
DI is modernizing defense all-source intelligence analysis through the development and implementation of advanced analytic methods and will accomplish this primarily by developing modernized analytic workflows concurrently with intelligence analysts to allow minimal disruptions to current analytic output which allows the analyst to “modernize in place.” In addition to developing new analytic approaches, ADO evaluates and integrates proposed analytic solutions.
The Office of the Research Director, DI leads planning, execution, and oversight of DIA intelligence research and analytic tradecraft. The Product Evaluation Team in the Office of the Research Director evaluates DIA analytic products to track DIA’s tradecraft performance across IC Analytic Tradecraft Standards. DIA submits an end of fiscal year report on analytic tradecraft performance and the health of its evaluation program to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). ODNI is Congressionally Directed to provide an annual briefing that presents data on the health of IC elements’ evaluation programs.
