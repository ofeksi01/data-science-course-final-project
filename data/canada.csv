Furthermore, we can build a newcomer database that allows various community stakeholders to reach potential newcomer customers through engagement automation under various brands and automation solutions.
Our extensive offerings include:
RealtorAccess: a platform that allows realtors to engage with the local Chinese community and deliver their expertise directly from their desktops.
Linli Talk: a smart social connector where neighbors are exposed to curated group gatherings to introduce them to a peer support network, matched English practice partners, and diverse community resources.
By building various automation to foster newcomers' integration process, data is aggregated, creating a neighborhood information center that empowers all community stakeholders with a more cost-efficient engagement process.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Fondé par le professeur Yoshua Bengio de l'Université de Montréal, Mila rassemble des chercheurs spécialisés en intelligence artificielle et plus précisément en apprentissage automatique, apprentissage profond et apprentissage par renforcement. Reconnu mondialement pour ses importantes contributions au domaine de l'apprentissage profond, Mila s'est particulièrement distingué dans la modélisation du langage, la traduction automatique, la reconnaissance d'objets et les modèles génératifs. Depuis 2017, Mila est le fruit d'une collaboration entre l'Université de Montréal et l'Université McGill, en lien étroit avec Polytechnique Montréal et HEC Montréal.
Mila s'est donné pour mission d'être un pôle mondial d'avancées scientifiques qui inspire l'innovation et l'essor de l'intelligence artificielle (IA) au bénéfice de tous.

Contexte
La puissante combinaison de l'intelligence artificielle et des neurosciences a permis des avancées significatives dans le domaine de l'interface neuronal au cours des dernières décennies, couvrant un large éventail de modalités et de techniques autant invasive (par exemple, la stimulation cérébrale profonde, les implants cochléaires) que non invasive (par exemple, l'électroencéphalographie (EEG), l'électromyographie (EMG)).
Cependant, les signaux neuronaux sont notoirement difficiles à analyser et à interpréter, ce qui fait de l'apprentissage automatique un outil clé pour les progrès de la neurotechnologie. Malgré de nombreux travaux récents, la plupart des systèmes d'apprentissage automatique pour la neurotechnologie sont très limités dans leur application et leur flexibilité globale. En général, ils sont formés à des tâches simples (par exemple, déplacer un curseur en fonction de l'activité cérébrale, moduler une neurostimulation ciblée) et sur des individus isolés. Même cela nécessite de grandes quantités de données neuronales dont l'acquisition peut être longue et coûteuse. D'autre part, des résultats récents dans le domaine de l'apprentissage automatique ont démontré l'immense potentiel de l'utilisation de grands modèles pré-entraînés sur diverses données en tant qu'épine dorsale pour le développement ultérieur.
Il a été démontré que ces ""modèles de base"" fonctionnent en tant qu'apprenants peu nombreux et dans d'autres domaines (tels que le traitement du langage naturel). Ainsi, une solution potentielle aux défis rencontrés par la neurotechnoligie consiste à développer des modèles de base et d'autres algorithmes adaptatifs de ML/AI pour décoder et stimuler l'activité cérébrale, qui pourraient être largement disponibles. Un certain nombre de groupes de recherche Mila travaillent activement dans ce domaine et ce rôle de développeur à pour mission de soutenir, augmenter l'impact et finalement déployer des outils d'IA/ML pour la neurotechnologie.
About Mila
Mila is a research institute pursuing scientific advances in AI for the benefit of all. By making our research results public, Mila seeks to contribute to the AI innovation ecosystem in Quebec and Canada more broadly.
Founded by Professor Yoshua Bengio, a pioneer in deep learning, Mila is the result of a unique collaboration between the Université de Montréal and McGill University, in close collaboration with Polytechnique Montréal and HEC Montréal. Mila is a vibrant research ecosystem that brings together more than 80 industry partners and 800+ of the world's best talents in artificial intelligence.
In addition to its academic training and fundamental research focus, Mila's mission is to contribute to Quebec and Canada's economic development through technology transfer and business innovation.
Background
The powerful combination of AI and neuroscience has yielded significant advances in neural interfacing over the past decades, spanning a wide range of modalities and techniques varying from invasive (e.g. deep brain stimulation, cochlear implants) to non-invasive (e.g. electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG)). However, neural signals are notoriously difficult to analyze and interpret, making machine learning a key tool for neurotech advances.
Yet, despite much recent work, most machine learning systems for neurotech are very limited in their application and overall flexibility. Typically, they are trained on simple tasks (e.g. moving a cursor with brain activity, modulating targeted neurostimulation) and on single individuals. Even this requires large amounts of neural data that can be time-consuming and expensive to acquire. At the same time, recent results in machine learning have demonstrated the immense potential of using large models pre-trained on diverse data as a backbone for subsequent development.
These ""foundation models"" have been shown to function as few-shot learners and in other areas (such as natural language processing). As such, a potential solution to the challenges faced by neurotech is to develop foundation models and other ML/AI adaptive algorithms for decoding and stimulating brain activity that could be made widely available. A number of Mila research groups are actively working in this area and this engineering role is envisioned to help support, scale, and ultimately deploy AI/ML tools for neurotech.

Who we are:
http://www.rideco.com
RideCo powers on-demand transit. Public transit agencies use RideCo's cloud-based software platform to provide on-demand shared rides in dynamically routed buses and shuttles. Our clients include some of the world’s largest transportation operators such as San Antonio Metro, Los Angeles Metro, Calgary Transit, and San Diego County.
Have you experienced getting frustrated with transfers and waiting while taking a public bus? Have you seen buses drive around in low-density areas with very few passengers on-board and wondered how inefficient that seems to be? You're likely aware of the first & last mile access challenges faced by transit hubs. We are solving these problems by re-imagining shared mobility. Imagine a world where vehicles have dynamic routes responsive to real-time trip demand. This 'dynamic shuttle' (or van /sedan) would pick you up, on-demand, at or near your doorstep and take you to your destination or transit hub. Along the way, it may pick-up other passengers going in your direction. Your experience will be seamless: less waiting, less walking, fewer transfers, shorter travel time, and timely pickups and drop-offs. RideCo's 'dynamic shuttle' platform enables this seamless experience and low-cost shared rides for vehicle fleet operators and their passengers. By seamlessly moving more people in fewer vehicles we are catalyzing a generational shift in how people get around cities and towns. This means commuters spend less time in transit and more time doing what they enjoy.
RideCo powers a diverse range of use cases, including residential/ suburban travel; first-mile-last-mile connections for transit hubs; and corporate employee transportation. We are investing to scale up and capture the growing demand for on-demand shared rides solutions.

RideCo is proud to be an equal opportunity employer, we are committed to building and supporting a culture of diversity, inclusion, and accessibility. We hire the best talent regardless of race, color, creed, national origin, ancestry, disability, marital status, age, veteran status, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, and expression.

A demonstrated capability for applied research, the curiosity to uncover promising solutions to new problems, and the persistence to carry your ideas through to an end goal.
The motivation to develop deep product and business knowledge and to connect abstract modeling and analysis tasks with business value.
Comfortable working in a Unix environment.

What you'll get:
This opportunity has the option to be fully remote in all locations across Canada.

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.
Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Experience with Databricks and Delta Lake.
Experience working with AWS, Kubernetes.
Experience with entity resolution and enrichment-focused data pipelines.
How we work:
Our culture is a key part of how we operate as well as our hiring process:
We iterate quickly. As such, you must be comfortable embracing ambiguity, be able to cut through it, and deliver incremental value to our customers each sprint.
We are candid, transparent, and speak our minds while simultaneously caring personally with each person we interact with.
We make data driven decisions and make the best decision for the moment based on the information available.

Yelp engineering culture is driven by our values: we’re a cooperative team that values individual authenticity and encourages creative solutions to problems. All new engineers deploy working code their first week, and we strive to broaden individual impact with support from managers, mentors, and teams. At the end of the day, we’re all about helping our users, growing as engineers, and having fun in a collaborative environment.

Are you passionate about applying statistical modeling, machine learning, algorithm design, and experimentation to make high-quality, high-impact solutions? Do you want to help local businesses grow and succeed? Yelp's Ads group works on challenging, multi-disciplinary problems at scale—spanning machine learning, data structures & algorithms, optimization, statistics and distributed systems—with the goal of creating a healthy, valued marketplace between customers and advertisers.

As an applied scientist within the Ads group, you will be joining a team that focuses on pricing and auction bidding strategies, control systems, and experimentation. Applied scientists uncover these insights through exploratory research and analysis, and carry the ideas all the way through to production-grade statistical or predictive models. Making sense of this data, thinking deeply about system design, and figuring out different network interactions is hard work, but these insights are hugely impactful to Yelp’s business.

This opportunity is fully remote and does not require you to be located in any particular area in Canada. We welcome applicants from throughout Canada. We’d love to have you apply, even if you don’t feel you meet every single requirement in this posting. At Yelp, we’re looking for great people, not just those who simply check off all the boxes.

What you'll do:
Identify and own challenging problems, form testable hypotheses, and drive significant business impact.
Lead the design and analysis of experiments or development of causal and predictive models to test your ideas.
Collaborate with product and engineering to affect changes in production systems and provide intelligence to other teams.
Communicate your conclusions to technical and non-technical audiences alike.
Keep the team and our projects current on new developments in ML and statistics by reading papers and attending conferences and local events.
Productionize and automate model pipelines within Python services.

What it takes to succeed:
A Bachelor’s Degree or an equivalent work experience is required.
A degree in a quantitative discipline such as Computer Science, Statistics, Econometrics, Applied Math, Physics, etc.
Experience with data analysis/statistical software and packages (pandas/statsmodels/sklearn within Python, R, etc.).
Experience with predictive modeling/machine learning, forecasting, or causal inference.
A love for writing beautiful code; you don’t need to be an expert, but experience is a plus and we’ll expect you to learn on the job.
A demonstrated capability for applied research, the curiosity to uncover promising solutions to new problems, and the persistence to carry your ideas through to an end goal.
The motivation to develop deep product and business knowledge and to connect abstract modeling and analysis tasks with business value.
Comfortable working in a Unix environment.

What you'll get:
This opportunity has the option to be fully remote in all locations across Canada.

Yelp engineering culture is driven by our values: we’re a cooperative team that values individual authenticity and encourages creative solutions to problems. All new engineers deploy working code their first week, and we strive to broaden individual impact with support from managers, mentors, and teams. At the end of the day, we’re all about helping our users, growing as engineers, and having fun in a collaborative environment.

Are you passionate about applying statistical modeling, machine learning, algorithm design, and experimentation to make high-quality, high-impact solutions?

As an applied scientist within the Ads group, you will be joining a team that focuses on pricing and auction bidding strategies, control systems, and experimentation. Applied scientists uncover these insights through exploratory research and analysis, and carry the ideas all the way through to production-grade statistical or predictive models. Making sense of this data, thinking deeply about system design, and figuring out different network interactions is hard work, but these insights are hugely impactful to Yelp’s business.

This opportunity is fully remote and does not require you to be located in any particular area in Canada. We welcome applicants from throughout Canada. We’d love to have you apply, even if you don’t feel you meet every single requirement in this posting. At Yelp, we’re looking for great people, not just those who simply check off all the boxes.

What you'll do:
Identify and own challenging problems, form testable hypotheses, and drive significant business impact.
Lead the design and analysis of experiments or development of causal and predictive models to test your ideas.
Collaborate with product and engineering to affect changes in production systems and provide intelligence to other teams.
Communicate your conclusions to technical and non-technical audiences alike.
Keep the team and our projects current on new developments in ML and statistics by reading papers and attending conferences and local events.
Productionize and automate model pipelines within Python services.

What it takes to succeed:
A Bachelor’s Degree or an equivalent work experience is required.
A degree in a quantitative discipline such as Computer Science, Statistics, Econometrics, Applied Math, Physics, etc.
Experience with data analysis/statistical software and packages (pandas/statsmodels/sklearn within Python, R, etc.).
Experience with predictive modeling/machine learning, forecasting, or causal inference.
A love for writing beautiful code; you don’t need to be an expert, but experience is a plus and we’ll expect you to learn on the job.
A demonstrated capability for applied research, the curiosity to uncover promising solutions to new problems, and the persistence to carry your ideas through to an end goal.
The motivation to develop deep product and business knowledge and to connect abstract modeling and analysis tasks with business value.
Comfortable working in a Unix environment.

What you'll get:
This opportunity has the option to be fully remote in all locations across Canada.

A love for writing beautiful code; you don’t need to be an expert, but experience is a plus and we’ll expect you to learn on the job.
A demonstrated capability for applied research, the curiosity to uncover promising solutions to new problems, and the persistence to carry your ideas through to an end goal.
The motivation to develop deep product and business knowledge and to connect abstract modeling and analysis tasks with business value.
Comfortable working in a Unix environment.
