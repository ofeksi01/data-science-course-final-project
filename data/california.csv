We are fulfilling this audacious mission by building a scalable virtual-first primary care service that provides patients with high-quality care anytime, anywhere, from any device, at a very affordable price, by blending high-touch clinical care and artificial intelligence.

Our company is remote-first and we consider candidates across the United States.

Machine Learning at Curai

We are looking for a Senior ML Engineer to join the machine learning team at Curai. Our team is responsible for Curai’s ML/automation technology and drives the strategy: ML as part of the physician care team will drastically reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of providers. Your work will have a tremendous direct impact on both provider and patient-facing ML-augmented applications, thereby providing low-friction, high-quality care to patients of Curai Health.

We are primarily a text-based service and NLP is at the core of our ML work. With recent advances in large language models, we are seeing a tremendous acceleration in capabilities. A non-trivial part of our work involves appropriately leveraging and building on top of these models thoughtfully (and with scaffolding) to our use cases and backing them up with a sound automated evaluation. In addition, we use the in-house deidentified data as robust feedback data for continuously improving the ML models.

We are excellent collaborators, within our team and across teams with product owners, engineers, and clinicians to deliver automated products for doctors and patients. A successful candidate will own and help engineer end-to-end, AI/ML-powered automated systems in service of better health outcomes at lower costs.

What You’ll Do
Design, build, deploy, and improve machine learning models, including those that are based on large language models. These models are used in our patient and physician-facing product features and developed in collaboration with our clinical innovation, research, engineering, and design teams.
Design offline and online evaluations to test ML product features, and perform data-driven analysis of the results to find actionable insights.
Enable rapid and rigorous scientific innovation by a multidisciplinary team of Curai clinicians, engineers, and researchers, through platform, tools, and documentation.
Participate in interviewing diverse talent to build and grow a strong ML engineering team.

What You’ll Need
“End-to-end” experience building ML production systems: Along with strong ML fundamentals, you will need exposure to the entire lifecycle of machine learning production systems, such as data processing, modeling, deployment, monitoring, maintenance, and improving the models over time using feedback loops.
Experience in natural language processing applications
""Product sense"" or intuition on what to build: With guidance, you will need to be able to translate product intuition into data-driven hypotheses that result in impactful machine learning/engineering solutions.
Strong communication skills: This role involves collaboration with product, engineering, clinical, and research teams. Understanding the mental models of the audience and communicating ideas crisply to this diverse set of stakeholders will be a vital part of the role. You should be comfortable leading cross-functional machine learning product initiatives, from conception to successful product outcomes.

At Anyscale, we're on a mission to democratize distributed computing and make it accessible to software developers of all skill levels. We’re commercializing Ray, a popular open-source project that's creating an ecosystem of libraries for scalable machine learning. Companies like OpenAI, Uber, Spotify, Instacart, Cruise, and many more, have Ray in their tech stacks to accelerate the progress of AI applications out into the real world.

With Anyscale, we’re building the best place to run Ray, so that any developer or data scientist can scale an ML application from their laptop to the cluster without needing to be a distributed systems expert.

We're a San Francisco based company, proud to be backed by $250+ million from top-tier investors like Andreessen Horowitz, NEA, and Addition.

About the role:
Anyscale is looking to hire strong individuals to develop open source machine learning libraries.

The software industry largely operates on a messy zoo of specialized distributed systems such as Spark, Horovod, and TensorFlow Serving. These systems cannot easily be composed together and used as elements of a larger application. On the Machine Learning Ecosystem team at Anyscale, we are developing a rich ecosystem that will allow developers to import powerful distributed libraries and compose them together to build new applications.

Part of this work will be open source as part of Ray, which is a distributed Python execution engine as well as an ecosystem of libraries for scalable machine learning.

About the Libraries team:
The Libraries team’s mission is to make it really easy to do distributed machine learning on Ray and Anyscale. Specifically, our team maintains and develops features for a broad number of libraries — including Ray Train (distributed deep learning), Ray Tune (distributed hyperparameter tuning), RLlib (reinforcement learning), and XGBoost-on-Ray.

Our team is the most user-facing engineering team on the open source side, collaborating with ML engineering teams at organizations like Shopify, Uber, and Bytedance.

As part of this role, you will:
Build elastic, scalable, fault-tolerant distributed machine learning libraries that power the next generation of machine learning platforms around the world
Benchmark and improve performance and scalability of different machine learning libraries
Work closely with other engineers developing Ray to build core abstractions and simplify machine learning services for open source users
Work closely with the open source community (with ML researchers, ML engineers, data scientists) to scope and build new abstractions for scalable machine learning
We'd love to hear from you if you have:
Solid background in algorithms, data structures, system design
Experience with machine learning frameworks and libraries (PyTorch, Tensorflow)
Bonus points!
Experience working with a cloud technology stack (AWS, GCP, Kubernetes)
Experience building machine learning training pipelines or inference services in a production setting
Experience with big data tools (Spark, Flink, Hadoop)
Experience in building scalable and fault-tolerant distributed systems

Compensation
At Anyscale, we take a market-based approach to compensation. We are data-driven, transparent, and consistent. The target salary for this role is $170,112 ~ $237,000. As the market data changes over time, the target salary for this role may be adjusted.

This role is also eligible to participate in Anyscale's Equity and Benefits offerings, including the following:

Stock Options
Healthcare plans, with premiums covered by Anyscale at 99%
401k Retirement Plan
Wellness stipend
Education stipend
Paid Parental Leave
Paid Time Off
Commute reimbursement

At Anyscale, we're on a mission to democratize distributed computing and make it accessible to software developers of all skill levels. We’re commercializing Ray, a popular open-source project that's creating an ecosystem of libraries for scalable machine learning. Companies like OpenAI, Uber, Spotify, Instacart, Cruise, and many more, have Ray in their tech stacks to accelerate the progress of AI applications out into the real world.

With Anyscale, we’re building the best place to run Ray, so that any developer or data scientist can scale an ML application from their laptop to the cluster without needing to be a distributed systems expert.

We're a San Francisco based company, proud to be backed by $250+ million from top-tier investors like Andreessen Horowitz, NEA, and Addition.

About the role:
Anyscale is looking to hire strong individuals to develop open source machine learning libraries.

The software industry largely operates on a messy zoo of specialized distributed systems such as Spark, Horovod, and TensorFlow Serving. These systems cannot easily be composed together and used as elements of a larger application. On the Machine Learning Ecosystem team at Anyscale, we are developing a rich ecosystem that will allow developers to import powerful distributed libraries and compose them together to build new applications.

Part of this work will be open source as part of Ray, which is a distributed Python execution engine as well as an ecosystem of libraries for scalable machine learning.

About the Libraries team:
The Libraries team’s mission is to make it really easy to do distributed machine learning on Ray and Anyscale. Specifically, our team maintains and develops features for a broad number of libraries — including Ray Train (distributed deep learning), Ray Tune (distributed hyperparameter tuning), RLlib (reinforcement learning), and XGBoost-on-Ray.

Our team is the most user-facing engineering team on the open source side, collaborating with ML engineering teams at organizations like Shopify, Uber, and Bytedance.

As part of this role, you will:
Build elastic, scalable, fault-tolerant distributed machine learning libraries that power the next generation of machine learning platforms around the world
Benchmark and improve performance and scalability of different machine learning libraries
Work closely with other engineers developing Ray to build core abstractions and simplify machine learning services for open source users
Work closely with the open source community (with ML researchers, ML engineers, data scientists) to scope and build new abstractions for scalable machine learning
We'd love to hear from you if you have:
Solid background in algorithms, data structures, system design
Experience with machine learning frameworks and libraries (PyTorch, Tensorflow)
Bonus points!
Experience working with a cloud technology stack (AWS, GCP, Kubernetes)
Experience building machine learning training pipelines or inference services in a production setting
Experience with big data tools (Spark, Flink, Hadoop)

At Anyscale, we're on a mission to democratize distributed computing and make it accessible to software developers of all skill levels. We’re commercializing Ray, a popular open-source project that's creating an ecosystem of libraries for scalable machine learning. Companies like OpenAI, Uber, Spotify, Instacart, Cruise, and many more, have Ray in their tech stacks to accelerate the progress of AI applications out into the real world.

With Anyscale, we’re building the best place to run Ray, so that any developer or data scientist can scale an ML application from their laptop to the cluster without needing to be a distributed systems expert.

We're a San Francisco based company, proud to be backed by $250+ million from top-tier investors like Andreessen Horowitz, NEA, and Addition.

About the role:
Anyscale is looking to hire strong individuals to develop open source machine learning libraries.

The software industry largely operates on a messy zoo of specialized distributed systems such as Spark, Horovod, and TensorFlow Serving. These systems cannot easily be composed together and used as elements of a larger application. On the Machine Learning Ecosystem team at Anyscale, we are developing a rich ecosystem that will allow developers to import powerful distributed libraries and compose them together to build new applications.

Part of this work will be open source as part of Ray, which is a distributed Python execution engine as well as an ecosystem of libraries for scalable machine learning.

About the Libraries team:
The Libraries team’s mission is to make it really easy to do distributed machine learning on Ray and Anyscale. Specifically, our team maintains and develops features for a broad number of libraries — including Ray Train (distributed deep learning), Ray Tune (distributed hyperparameter tuning), RLlib (reinforcement learning), and XGBoost-on-Ray.

Our team is the most user-facing engineering team on the open source side, collaborating with ML engineering teams at organizations like Shopify, Uber, and Bytedance.

As part of this role, you will:
Build elastic, scalable, fault-tolerant distributed machine learning libraries that power the next generation of machine learning platforms around the world
Benchmark and improve performance and scalability of different machine learning libraries
Work closely with other engineers developing Ray to build core abstractions and simplify machine learning services for open source users
Work closely with the open source community (with ML researchers, ML engineers, data scientists) to scope and build new abstractions for scalable machine learning
We'd love to hear from you if you have:
Solid background in algorithms, data structures, system design
Experience with machine learning frameworks and libraries (PyTorch, Tensorflow)
Bonus points!
Experience working with a cloud technology stack (AWS, GCP, Kubernetes)
Experience building machine learning training pipelines or inference services in a production setting
Experience with big data tools (Spark, Flink, Hadoop)
Experience in building scalable and fault-tolerant distributed systems

Compensation
At Anyscale, we take a market-based approach to compensation. We are data-driven, transparent, and consistent. The target salary for this role is $170,112 ~ $237,000. As the market data changes over time, the target salary for this role may be adjusted.

This role is also eligible to participate in Anyscale's Equity and Benefits offerings, including the following:

Experience working with a cloud technology stack (AWS, GCP, Kubernetes)
Experience building machine learning training pipelines or inference services in a production setting
Experience with big data tools (Spark, Flink, Hadoop)
Experience in building scalable and fault-tolerant distributed systems

Compensation
At Anyscale, we take a market-based approach to compensation. We are data-driven, transparent, and consistent. The target salary for this role is $170,112 ~ $237,000. As the market data changes over time, the target salary for this role may be adjusted.

This role is also eligible to participate in Anyscale's Equity and Benefits offerings, including the following:

Our team is the most user-facing engineering team on the open source side, collaborating with ML engineering teams at organizations like Shopify, Uber, and Bytedance.

As part of this role, you will:
Build elastic, scalable, fault-tolerant distributed machine learning libraries that power the next generation of machine learning platforms around the world
Benchmark and improve performance and scalability of different machine learning libraries
Work closely with other engineers developing Ray to build core abstractions and simplify machine learning services for open source users
Work closely with the open source community (with ML researchers, ML engineers, data scientists) to scope and build new abstractions for scalable machine learning
We'd love to hear from you if you have:
Solid background in algorithms, data structures, system design
Experience with machine learning frameworks and libraries (PyTorch, Tensorflow)
Bonus points!
Experience working with a cloud technology stack (AWS, GCP, Kubernetes)
Experience building machine learning training pipelines or inference services in a production setting
Experience with big data tools (Spark, Flink, Hadoop)
Experience in building scalable and fault-tolerant distributed systems

Compensation
At Anyscale, we take a market-based approach to compensation. We are data-driven, transparent, and consistent. The target salary for this role is $170,112 ~ $237,000. As the market data changes over time, the target salary for this role may be adjusted.

This role is also eligible to participate in Anyscale's Equity and Benefits offerings, including the following:

At Anyscale, we're on a mission to democratize distributed computing and make it accessible to software developers of all skill levels. We’re commercializing Ray, a popular open-source project that's creating an ecosystem of libraries for scalable machine learning. Companies like OpenAI, Uber, Spotify, Instacart, Cruise, and many more, have Ray in their tech stacks to accelerate the progress of AI applications out into the real world.

With Anyscale, we’re building the best place to run Ray, so that any developer or data scientist can scale an ML application from their laptop to the cluster without needing to be a distributed systems expert.

We're a San Francisco based company, proud to be backed by $250+ million from top-tier investors like Andreessen Horowitz, NEA, and Addition.

About the role:
Anyscale is looking to hire strong individuals to develop open source machine learning libraries.

The software industry largely operates on a messy zoo of specialized distributed systems such as Spark, Horovod, and TensorFlow Serving. These systems cannot easily be composed together and used as elements of a larger application. On the Machine Learning Ecosystem team at Anyscale, we are developing a rich ecosystem that will allow developers to import powerful distributed libraries and compose them together to build new applications.

Part of this work will be open source as part of Ray, which is a distributed Python execution engine as well as an ecosystem of libraries for scalable machine learning.

About the Libraries team:
The Libraries team’s mission is to make it really easy to do distributed machine learning on Ray and Anyscale. Specifically, our team maintains and develops features for a broad number of libraries — including Ray Train (distributed deep learning), Ray Tune (distributed hyperparameter tuning), RLlib (reinforcement learning), and XGBoost-on-Ray.

Our team is the most user-facing engineering team on the open source side, collaborating with ML engineering teams at organizations like Shopify, Uber, and Bytedance.

As part of this role, you will:
Build elastic, scalable, fault-tolerant distributed machine learning libraries that power the next generation of machine learning platforms around the world
Benchmark and improve performance and scalability of different machine learning libraries
Work closely with other engineers developing Ray to build core abstractions and simplify machine learning services for open source users
Work closely with the open source community (with ML researchers, ML engineers, data scientists) to scope and build new abstractions for scalable machine learning

Experience working with a cloud technology stack (AWS, GCP, Kubernetes)
Experience building machine learning training pipelines or inference services in a production setting
Experience with big data tools (Spark, Flink, Hadoop)
Experience in building scalable and fault-tolerant distributed systems

Compensation
At Anyscale, we take a market-based approach to compensation. We are data-driven, transparent, and consistent. The target salary for this role is $170,112 ~ $237,000. As the market data changes over time, the target salary for this role may be adjusted.

This role is also eligible to participate in Anyscale's Equity and Benefits offerings, including the following:

We're a San Francisco based company, proud to be backed by $250+ million from top-tier investors like Andreessen Horowitz, NEA, and Addition.

About the role:
Anyscale is looking to hire strong individuals to develop open source machine learning libraries.

The software industry largely operates on a messy zoo of specialized distributed systems such as Spark, Horovod, and TensorFlow Serving. These systems cannot easily be composed together and used as elements of a larger application. On the Machine Learning Ecosystem team at Anyscale, we are developing a rich ecosystem that will allow developers to import powerful distributed libraries and compose them together to build new applications.

Part of this work will be open source as part of Ray, which is a distributed Python execution engine as well as an ecosystem of libraries for scalable machine learning.

The Libraries team’s mission is to make it really easy to do distributed machine learning on Ray and Anyscale. Specifically, our team maintains and develops features for a broad number of libraries — including Ray Train (distributed deep learning), Ray Tune (distributed hyperparameter tuning), RLlib (reinforcement learning), and XGBoost-on-Ray.

Our team is the most user-facing engineering team on the open source side, collaborating with ML engineering teams at organizations like Shopify, Uber, and Bytedance.

As part of this role, you will:
Build elastic, scalable, fault-tolerant distributed machine learning libraries that power the next generation of machine learning platforms around the world
Benchmark and improve performance and scalability of different machine learning libraries
Work closely with other engineers developing Ray to build core abstractions and simplify machine learning services for open source users
Work closely with the open source community (with ML researchers, ML engineers, data scientists) to scope and build new abstractions for scalable machine learning
We'd love to hear from you if you have:
Solid background in algorithms, data structures, system design
Experience with machine learning frameworks and libraries (PyTorch, Tensorflow)
Bonus points!
Experience working with a cloud technology stack (AWS, GCP, Kubernetes)
Experience building machine learning training pipelines or inference services in a production setting
Experience with big data tools (Spark, Flink, Hadoop)
Experience in building scalable and fault-tolerant distributed systems

Compensation
At Anyscale, we take a market-based approach to compensation. We are data-driven, transparent, and consistent. The target salary for this role is $170,112 ~ $237,000. As the market data changes over time, the target salary for this role may be adjusted.

This role is also eligible to participate in Anyscale's Equity and Benefits offerings, including the following:

The Libraries team’s mission is to make it really easy to do distributed machine learning on Ray and Anyscale. Specifically, our team maintains and develops features for a broad number of libraries — including Ray Train (distributed deep learning), Ray Tune (distributed hyperparameter tuning), RLlib (reinforcement learning), and XGBoost-on-Ray.

Our team is the most user-facing engineering team on the open source side, collaborating with ML engineering teams at organizations like Shopify, Uber, and Bytedance.

As part of this role, you will:
Build elastic, scalable, fault-tolerant distributed machine learning libraries that power the next generation of machine learning platforms around the world
Benchmark and improve performance and scalability of different machine learning libraries
Work closely with other engineers developing Ray to build core abstractions and simplify machine learning services for open source users
Work closely with the open source community (with ML researchers, ML engineers, data scientists) to scope and build new abstractions for scalable machine learning

Experience working with a cloud technology stack (AWS, GCP, Kubernetes)
Experience building machine learning training pipelines or inference services in a production setting
Experience with big data tools (Spark, Flink, Hadoop)
Experience in building scalable and fault-tolerant distributed systems

Compensation
At Anyscale, we take a market-based approach to compensation. We are data-driven, transparent, and consistent. The target salary for this role is $170,112 ~ $237,000. As the market data changes over time, the target salary for this role may be adjusted.

This role is also eligible to participate in Anyscale's Equity and Benefits offerings, including the following:
