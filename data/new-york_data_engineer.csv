-

Building an inclusive culture is one of our core tenets as a company. We’re very aware of the structural inequalities that exist, and recognize that underrepresented minorities are less likely to apply for a role if they don’t think they meet all of the requirements. If that’s you and you’re reading this, we’d like to encourage you to apply regardless — we’d love to get to know you and see if there’s a place for you here!

About Our Mission
At Juniper, we're building software for behavioral health clinicians to improve quality of care. We streamline and replace manual efforts so clinicians can focus on what they do best: providing high-quality care.

We started Juniper because we care about impact — the lack of supply for behavioral healthcare means those who need it most cannot access it. We believe this is one of the biggest problems out there today. It’s why we’re tackling this broken industry, and why we want you on this mission with us.

For more details on our thesis, check out our write-up What is Juniper?.

About Our Culture
Our mission to change behavioral health starts with us and and how we operate. We don’t want to just change behavioral health, we want to change the way startups operate. Here are a few tactical examples:
1) Diversity, equity, and inclusion has been a priority since day 1. Currently, half of our leadership team (COO + CTO) identify as female, and our cap table includes over a dozen women. We still have a ways to go, but we’re committed to sourcing, hiring, and retaining talent from underrepresented folks in tech and outside of tech.
2) Behavioral health is something we live and breathe — all four members of the Juniper leadership team see therapists every week, and we have a specific mental health benefit to help if that's something you're interested in exploring!
3) We have to have a sense of humor. Healthcare is so broken, it's depressing if you don't laugh with us.

For more details take a look at our FAQs \u007C Joining the Juniper Team!

About The Role
Our team is growing rapidly, and we’re looking for mission-driven engineers who care about creating positive impact, love solving challenging problems, and will thrive in the fast-paced start-up life. This person will work propose and lead new projects, and help us define how data influences the company’s technical and product direction.
What you’ll do:
Architect and deliver end-to-end implementation of projects and features — this includes running experiments, scoping features, producing design docs, implementing, testing, and maintaining a scalable codebase.
Work with us to define and drive product features and technical direction of the company.
Collaborate with both technical and non-technical teammates across a wide range of functions, including mentoring.
Uphold security requirements and maintaining compliance with HIPAA security regulations.
What we’re looking for:
Throughput, velocity, and independence — an ability to drive and build projects from 0 to 1. To identify problems, build alignment, and implement solutions autonomously.
Prioritization of engineering as a craft — beyond implementation that meets functional requirements, also strives for implementation that is readable, maintainable, and scalable.
Growth mindset — a mentality of approaching unknowns with excitement, a penchant for learning new skills and technologies to solve new engineering challenges.
Alignment on company values — it’s the first chapter of our company story. You’ll be expected to cultivate and nurture existing values, and also play a lead role in shaping how it unfolds.
Juniper is based in New York City and are prioritizing in-person and hybrid candidates.

About the Central Data team
Effectively leveraging data to improve recipient experience, increase operational efficiency, and maximize fundraising revenue is imperative to successfully scaling to reach millions of people experiencing extreme poverty.
To realize this vision, we are building a best-in-class full stack data team. You will report to the Senior Data Manager and join the Senior Data Architect in owning the core data infrastructure and pipelines required for cash delivery, fundraising, and financial analysis. This is an opportunity to join a fast-paced, early stage team of five staff that applies engineering best practices and a product development approach to data.
Our data infrastructure is built on AWS and Databricks, with dashboards and visualizations in Tableau. We use a configuration-driven data pipeline framework developed by the Senior Data Architect based on SQL and Python.
About this role
Success in this role is determined by meeting these key objectives:
[30%] Build data pipelines within the configuration-driven framework to integrate new data sources into the data lakehouse:

[40%] Build stability, security, and data quality features into core infrastructure:
Automate data quality checks, testing, and alerting.
Own pipeline and job monitoring, resolving failures and developing safeguards.
Use Git-based code repository and workflows for code review and deployment.
[20%] Increase transparency of data and platform process:
Support development of a data catalog and maintain platform documentation.
Onboard other members of Central Data to build their own pipelines within the data lakehouse.
[10%] Build data visualizations in Tableau:
End-to-end data support is occasionally required, which will include building data visualizations in addition to pipelines.
This role is fully remote but must overlap with the East Africa timezone by at least 3 hours to take meetings with stakeholders working in our country offices. For candidates in North and South America, this typically means taking some meetings between 9-11am Eastern Standard Time, with occasional meetings as early as 7am EST (meetings this early are rare but do happen from time to time).

Building an inclusive culture is one of our core tenets as a company. We’re very aware of the structural inequalities that exist, and recognize that underrepresented minorities are less likely to apply for a role if they don’t think they meet all of the requirements. If that’s you and you’re reading this, we’d like to encourage you to apply regardless — we’d love to get to know you and see if there’s a place for you here!

About Our Mission
At Juniper, we're building software for behavioral health clinicians to improve quality of care. We streamline and replace manual efforts so clinicians can focus on what they do best: providing high-quality care.

We started Juniper because we care about impact — the lack of supply for behavioral healthcare means those who need it most cannot access it. We believe this is one of the biggest problems out there today. It’s why we’re tackling this broken industry, and why we want you on this mission with us.

For more details on our thesis, check out our write-up What is Juniper?.

About Our Culture
Our mission to change behavioral health starts with us and and how we operate. We don’t want to just change behavioral health, we want to change the way startups operate. Here are a few tactical examples:
1) Diversity, equity, and inclusion has been a priority since day 1. Currently, half of our leadership team (COO + CTO) identify as female, and our cap table includes over a dozen women. We still have a ways to go, but we’re committed to sourcing, hiring, and retaining talent from underrepresented folks in tech and outside of tech.
2) Behavioral health is something we live and breathe — all four members of the Juniper leadership team see therapists every week, and we have a specific mental health benefit to help if that's something you're interested in exploring!
3) We have to have a sense of humor. Healthcare is so broken, it's depressing if you don't laugh with us.

For more details take a look at our FAQs \u007C Joining the Juniper Team!

About The Role
Our team is growing rapidly, and we’re looking for mission-driven engineers who care about creating positive impact, love solving challenging problems, and will thrive in the fast-paced start-up life. This person will work propose and lead new projects, and help us define how data influences the company’s technical and product direction.
What you’ll do:
Architect and deliver end-to-end implementation of projects and features — this includes running experiments, scoping features, producing design docs, implementing, testing, and maintaining a scalable codebase.
Work with us to define and drive product features and technical direction of the company.
Collaborate with both technical and non-technical teammates across a wide range of functions, including mentoring.
Uphold security requirements and maintaining compliance with HIPAA security regulations.
What we’re looking for:
Throughput, velocity, and independence — an ability to drive and build projects from 0 to 1. To identify problems, build alignment, and implement solutions autonomously.
Prioritization of engineering as a craft — beyond implementation that meets functional requirements, also strives for implementation that is readable, maintainable, and scalable.
Growth mindset — a mentality of approaching unknowns with excitement, a penchant for learning new skills and technologies to solve new engineering challenges.
Alignment on company values — it’s the first chapter of our company story. You’ll be expected to cultivate and nurture existing values, and also play a lead role in shaping how it unfolds.

GiveDirectly (GD) provides cash grants directly to people living in extreme poverty. GD has raised over $800M since launching in 2011, delivered cash to more than 1.2 million recipients, and launched offices in 11 countries. We're continuing expansion across the Global South. Over the past decade, GD has also supported large-scale, experimental research, expanding the evidence that cash has a positive short and long-term impact on recipients. As a result, GD has been celebrated as one of the most innovative non-profit companies by Fast Company, while the growing cash transfer movement (and GD's leading role within it) has been featured in the New York Times Magazine, This American Life, Foreign Affairs, and The Economist.
Across our global offices, our culture is candid, analytical, non-hierarchical, and agile. We work alongside 750+ individuals who come from 21 different countries and speak 69 different languages. Team members at GiveDirectly attest that diversity, equity, and inclusion are not just buzzwords, but a fundamental part of our culture and values. We actively seek to recruit individuals from the communities we serve, and use DEI as a lens in our hiring practices, programs, and initiatives. Our goal is to maintain a workplace where everyone can bring their authentic selves to work, and feel valued and respected for who they are. We continue to grapple with balancing inclusivity of all cultures and experiences while maintaining cohesion in our values. While there is much that we are still learning, we take care of one another, have fun, as well as provide flexible working hours wherever possible.
We are proud to be an equal opportunity employer, and we do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, age, disability, or any other status protected by law.
About the Central Data team
Effectively leveraging data to improve recipient experience, increase operational efficiency, and maximize fundraising revenue is imperative to successfully scaling to reach millions of people experiencing extreme poverty.
To realize this vision, we are building a best-in-class full stack data team. You will report to the Senior Data Manager and join the Senior Data Architect in owning the core data infrastructure and pipelines required for cash delivery, fundraising, and financial analysis. This is an opportunity to join a fast-paced, early stage team of five staff that applies engineering best practices and a product development approach to data.
Our data infrastructure is built on AWS and Databricks, with dashboards and visualizations in Tableau. We use a configuration-driven data pipeline framework developed by the Senior Data Architect based on SQL and Python.
About this role
Success in this role is determined by meeting these key objectives:
[30%] Build data pipelines within the configuration-driven framework to integrate new data sources into the data lakehouse:
We've onboarded a few key data sources, but have many additional integrations to build. These new pipelines will require augmenting the configuration-driven framework.
[40%] Build stability, security, and data quality features into core infrastructure:
Automate data quality checks, testing, and alerting.
Own pipeline and job monitoring, resolving failures and developing safeguards.
Use Git-based code repository and workflows for code review and deployment.
[20%] Increase transparency of data and platform process:
Support development of a data catalog and maintain platform documentation.
Onboard other members of Central Data to build their own pipelines within the data lakehouse.
[10%] Build data visualizations in Tableau:
End-to-end data support is occasionally required, which will include building data visualizations in addition to pipelines.
This role is fully remote but must overlap with the East Africa timezone by at least 3 hours to take meetings with stakeholders working in our country offices. For candidates in North and South America, this typically means taking some meetings between 9-11am Eastern Standard Time, with occasional meetings as early as 7am EST (meetings this early are rare but do happen from time to time).

[10%] Build data visualizations in Tableau:
End-to-end data support is occasionally required, which will include building data visualizations in addition to pipelines.
This role is fully remote but must overlap with the East Africa timezone by at least 3 hours to take meetings with stakeholders working in our country offices. For candidates in North and South America, this typically means taking some meetings between 9-11am Eastern Standard Time, with occasional meetings as early as 7am EST (meetings this early are rare but do happen from time to time).

About Our Mission
At Juniper, we're building software for behavioral health clinicians to improve quality of care. We streamline and replace manual efforts so clinicians can focus on what they do best: providing high-quality care.

We started Juniper because we care about impact — the lack of supply for behavioral healthcare means those who need it most cannot access it. We believe this is one of the biggest problems out there today. It’s why we’re tackling this broken industry, and why we want you on this mission with us.

For more details on our thesis, check out our write-up What is Juniper?.

About Our Culture
Our mission to change behavioral health starts with us and and how we operate. We don’t want to just change behavioral health, we want to change the way startups operate. Here are a few tactical examples:
1) Diversity, equity, and inclusion has been a priority since day 1. Currently, half of our leadership team (COO + CTO) identify as female, and our cap table includes over a dozen women. We still have a ways to go, but we’re committed to sourcing, hiring, and retaining talent from underrepresented folks in tech and outside of tech.
2) Behavioral health is something we live and breathe — all four members of the Juniper leadership team see therapists every week, and we have a specific mental health benefit to help if that's something you're interested in exploring!
3) We have to have a sense of humor. Healthcare is so broken, it's depressing if you don't laugh with us.

For more details take a look at our FAQs \u007C Joining the Juniper Team!

About The Role
Our team is growing rapidly, and we’re looking for mission-driven engineers who care about creating positive impact, love solving challenging problems, and will thrive in the fast-paced start-up life. This person will work propose and lead new projects, and help us define how data influences the company’s technical and product direction.

Building an inclusive culture is one of our core tenets as a company. We’re very aware of the structural inequalities that exist, and recognize that underrepresented minorities are less likely to apply for a role if they don’t think they meet all of the requirements.

About Our Mission
At Juniper, we're building software for behavioral health clinicians to improve quality of care. We streamline and replace manual efforts so clinicians can focus on what they do best: providing high-quality care.

We started Juniper because we care about impact — the lack of supply for behavioral healthcare means those who need it most cannot access it. We believe this is one of the biggest problems out there today. It’s why we’re tackling this broken industry, and why we want you on this mission with us.

For more details on our thesis, check out our write-up What is Juniper?.

About Our Culture
Our mission to change behavioral health starts with us and and how we operate. We don’t want to just change behavioral health, we want to change the way startups operate. Here are a few tactical examples:
1) Diversity, equity, and inclusion has been a priority since day 1. Currently, half of our leadership team (COO + CTO) identify as female, and our cap table includes over a dozen women. We still have a ways to go, but we’re committed to sourcing, hiring, and retaining talent from underrepresented folks in tech and outside of tech.
2) Behavioral health is something we live and breathe — all four members of the Juniper leadership team see therapists every week, and we have a specific mental health benefit to help if that's something you're interested in exploring!
3) We have to have a sense of humor. Healthcare is so broken, it's depressing if you don't laugh with us.

For more details take a look at our FAQs \u007C Joining the Juniper Team!

About The Role
Our team is growing rapidly, and we’re looking for mission-driven engineers who care about creating positive impact, love solving challenging problems, and will thrive in the fast-paced start-up life. This person will work propose and lead new projects, and help us define how data influences the company’s technical and product direction.
What you’ll do:
Architect and deliver end-to-end implementation of projects and features — this includes running experiments, scoping features, producing design docs, implementing, testing, and maintaining a scalable codebase.
Work with us to define and drive product features and technical direction of the company.
Collaborate with both technical and non-technical teammates across a wide range of functions, including mentoring.
Uphold security requirements and maintaining compliance with HIPAA security regulations.
What we’re looking for:
Throughput, velocity, and independence — an ability to drive and build projects from 0 to 1. To identify problems, build alignment, and implement solutions autonomously.
Prioritization of engineering as a craft — beyond implementation that meets functional requirements, also strives for implementation that is readable, maintainable, and scalable.
Growth mindset — a mentality of approaching unknowns with excitement, a penchant for learning new skills and technologies to solve new engineering challenges.
Alignment on company values — it’s the first chapter of our company story. You’ll be expected to cultivate and nurture existing values, and also play a lead role in shaping how it unfolds.

Building an inclusive culture is one of our core tenets as a company.

About Our Mission
At Juniper, we're building software for behavioral health clinicians to improve quality of care. We streamline and replace manual efforts so clinicians can focus on what they do best: providing high-quality care.

We started Juniper because we care about impact — the lack of supply for behavioral healthcare means those who need it most cannot access it. We believe this is one of the biggest problems out there today. It’s why we’re tackling this broken industry, and why we want you on this mission with us.

For more details on our thesis, check out our write-up What is Juniper?.

About Our Culture
Our mission to change behavioral health starts with us and and how we operate. We don’t want to just change behavioral health, we want to change the way startups operate. Here are a few tactical examples:
1) Diversity, equity, and inclusion has been a priority since day 1. Currently, half of our leadership team (COO + CTO) identify as female, and our cap table includes over a dozen women. We still have a ways to go, but we’re committed to sourcing, hiring, and retaining talent from underrepresented folks in tech and outside of tech.
2) Behavioral health is something we live and breathe — all four members of the Juniper leadership team see therapists every week, and we have a specific mental health benefit to help if that's something you're interested in exploring!
3) We have to have a sense of humor. Healthcare is so broken, it's depressing if you don't laugh with us.

For more details take a look at our FAQs \u007C Joining the Juniper Team!

About The Role
Our team is growing rapidly, and we’re looking for mission-driven engineers who care about creating positive impact, love solving challenging problems, and will thrive in the fast-paced start-up life. This person will work propose and lead new projects, and help us define how data influences the company’s technical and product direction.
What you’ll do:
Architect and deliver end-to-end implementation of projects and features — this includes running experiments, scoping features, producing design docs, implementing, testing, and maintaining a scalable codebase.
Work with us to define and drive product features and technical direction of the company.
Collaborate with both technical and non-technical teammates across a wide range of functions, including mentoring.
Uphold security requirements and maintaining compliance with HIPAA security regulations.
What we’re looking for:
Throughput, velocity, and independence — an ability to drive and build projects from 0 to 1. To identify problems, build alignment, and implement solutions autonomously.
Prioritization of engineering as a craft — beyond implementation that meets functional requirements, also strives for implementation that is readable, maintainable, and scalable.
Growth mindset — a mentality of approaching unknowns with excitement, a penchant for learning new skills and technologies to solve new engineering challenges.
Alignment on company values — it’s the first chapter of our company story. You’ll be expected to cultivate and nurture existing values, and also play a lead role in shaping how it unfolds.
