That would be hard. Yet, for engineers working on modern robotics systems (such as self-driving cars or drones), that’s an analogous reality. These engineers often struggle to make informed decisions about their robots when things aren’t working correctly, and have to hack together solutions in-house.

We're building a platform to ingest, search and analyze the vast amounts of data produced by robots. Our platform ingests data from a wide range of devices (such as cameras, lidars, radars, batteries, motors, and more), and then allows engineers to analyze and transform it. It’s AI. It's robotics. It’s autonomous systems. It’s the future. And it’s going to be huge. Join us!

We’re looking for a Senior Frontend Engineer to join our founding team. In this role, you will be responsible for creating groundbreaking new user experiences that use AI to power the search, analysis and visualization of sensor data. We expect you to be deeply familiar with modern web technologies and have prior experience building products at high growth startups.
TYPICAL QUALIFICATIONS
BS/MS/PhD in Computer Science or equivalent experience
At least 4 years of full-time experience building web applications
Expertise in JavaScript, TypeScript and React
Experience building scalable web applications with cross-browser support
Experience working closely with designers, product managers and backend engineers
Experience creating designs with HTML/CSS and modern frameworks (e.g. MUI)

ABOUT US

We are a small but mighty (and growing) group with a mission to help the industry build better robots and bring them to market faster. Our founding team is made up of experts in robotics, machine learning, computer vision and more. In past lives—we were founding engineers on the Amazon Prime Air team, led autonomy and simulation initiatives at Amazon Robotics, and implemented machine learning solutions from AWS into numerous Fortune 500 companies. We also count the Paul Allen Institute for AI as a co-founder, one of the world’s leading A.I. research institutions. We recently raised seed funding from some incredible investors, and we’re now moving fast to build for our customers.

WHY JOIN

BCG forecasts that the global robotics market will climb from $25 billion in 2021 to upwards of $260 billion by 2030. McKinsey forecasts that the global shared autonomous-driving market alone will be roughly $1.6 trillion by 2030. By any measure—the robotics industry is going to be huge—with the majority of that growth coming in the next 5-10 years. But what's clear is that the industry doesn’t have the tools to facilitate that growth.

As a seed-funded startup, we also have several unique benefits that you can’t really get anywhere else:

Personal impact — The opportunity to build something from the ground up and define a new product.

Founding title — You will be one of our first hires. For the rest of our days, no matter how many thousands of people join after you, you will always have that honor and distinction.

Early stage equity — Early stage risk comes with early stage equity for you. And none of us would be here if we didn’t think that our company will create tremendous value over time.

Access to unique learning opportunities — With the Allen Institute for AI (AI2) as a co-founder, our team gets access to numerous talks by leading AI researchers/paper authors, access to knowledge sharing amongst the community of hundreds of engineers that work for AI2 companies, and much more.",-1,-1,Unknown / Non-Applicable,-1

As a UW employee, you will enjoy generous benefits and work/life programs. For a complete description of our benefits for this position, please visit our website, click here.


As a UW employee, you have a unique opportunity to change lives on our campuses, in our state and around the world. UW employees offer their boundless energy, creative problem solving skills and dedication to build stronger minds and a healthier world.

UW faculty and staff also enjoy outstanding benefits, professional growth opportunities and unique resources in an environment noted for diversity, intellectual excitement, artistic pursuits and natural beauty.

The School of Environmental and Forest Sciences is looking for a Research Scientist/Engineer 3 to serve as Geospatial Data Analyst for Wildfire-Fuel Treatment Outcomes.

Large-scale severe wildfires are expected to become increasingly common throughout much of North America, necessitating scientific data to inform postfire management treatment options and outcomes. Forest managers need site-specific quantitative monitoring data to develop long-term adaptative restoration plans based on science.

We are seeking a Geospatial Data Analyst with expertise in fire modeling and remotely sensed data to support innovative wildfire research. The incumbent will work on a project to improve our understanding of the conditions under which fuel treatments produce desired socioecological outcomes when encountered by wildfire. The incumbent will join a team of postdoctoral scholars, federal scientists, and university faculty who will develop and refine a core, scalable methodology that leverages existing spatial datasets on landscape, fire, and fuel treatment characteristics. The research team will apply this methodology to observed wildfire-treatment encounters in different landscapes across the United States to produce empirical case studies of wildfire-treatment outcomes (WTO’s). Fuel treatments are intended to change fire behavior (e.g., reduced intensity, spread rate, or spotting potential) in the event of a wildfire.

The selected candidate will collaborate on research to evaluate in the Pacific Northwest the reduction of fire severity, successful containment of fire spread, reduction of impacts to homes and critical infrastructure. These three outcomes are connected to the three pillars of the National Cohesive Wildland Fire Management Strategy (“Cohesive Strategy”) of fire resilient landscapes, safe and effective wildfire response, and fire-adapted communities, respectively. The research takes advantage of the tremendous variation in landscape, fire, and treatment characteristics to conduct a set of natural experiments, taking a “big data” and remote sensing approach to learning from past fuel treatment activities. Such empirical, data-driven assessments of WTO’s are critical to inform process-based models of future treatment outcomes under a changing climate, to improve future treatment layout and design, to guide decision-making on incidents, and to improve adaptive management and monitoring of fuel treatment investments. The proposed research involves both place-based empirical case studies and methodological development; therefore, the incumbent will work with a postdoctoral scholar and collaborators to build a foundation for improving monitoring systems, rapidly assessing drivers of treatment effectiveness on landscapes of interest, and fostering collaborative learning with agency partners.

RESPONSIBILITIES:

Research

Incumbent will assemble, process, and analyze large remote sensing datasets (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel-2, MODIS) and spatial datasets (e.g., FACTs, FTEM, field data) of wildfires and operational fuel treatments using R/Python and Google Earth Engine. Selected candidate will use cartographic principles and conventions sufficient to create maps for external and internal use that display natural resource and socio-economic information and highlight particular analysis results.

The incumbent will use multi-analysis and machine-learning based integration of high-resolution satellite imagery, model generated data, and field data of wildfire-treatment outcomes.

Selected candidate will collaborate with the larger national research teams to develop and refine a core, scalable methodology that leverages existing spatial datasets on landscape, fire, and fuel treatment characteristics for large wildfires. The team will develop a process to apply methodologies to observed wildfire-treatment encounters in different landscapes across the United States to produce empirical case studies of wildfire-treatment outcomes.

To provide research support with statistical and geospatial analysis, wildland fire modeling, fuel and vegetation modeling, risk analysis, R or Python programming to research team.

To co-lead a field crew on establishment plots and collection of forest biometric data related to postfire stand conditions on selected recent wildfires where fuels have been treated in the Pacific Northwest in collaboration with a wide variety of federal, tribal, and state partners.

To collaborate closely with other team members located in other USFS Research Stations in the country. The research will be conducted in the laboratory and will require field visits to wildfire sites.

As 2021 Microsoft Power BI Partner of the Year, we enable leading companies to accelerate their business intelligence and analytics initiatives. Our solutions enable our clients to improve their operations, reduce costs, increase sales, and build stronger customer relationships.
Our clients consistently recognize us for providing architecture and governance frameworks, implementing best practices to optimize reports, and building team capability through training programs. Our innovative tools and 33 certified visuals expand Power BI capabilities to save time for decision makers.
As a premier supplier to Microsoft for two decades, our clients benefit from our extensive insights on the platform and engineering practices. As a Microsoft Partner with 10 Gold competencies, our clients improve their implementations with our breadth and depth of expertise.
With globally integrated teams in Redmond, Washington, and Mumbai, Hyderabad, and NOIDA India, we deliver solutions with increased velocity and tech intensity.
Inc. magazine has recognized us for sustained growth by listing us on the Inc. 5000 list ten times – a rare honor.

Engineering culture
We foster a strong engineering culture with a can-do attitude. All our key managers come from excellent educational backgrounds and have significant experience growing a company and mentoring software engineers. Due to our smaller size, we adopt the latest technologies and computing trends ahead of the larger industry players. As a part of the company’s globally distributed engineering team, our engineers gain exposure to the latest software engineering practices and fast development cycles.
Our developers routinely work on challenging technical problems that utilize the latest technologies for fast-paced software delivery.

Examples of some of our projects:
We built a supervised machine learning model that forecasts the impact of retail sales on our client’s overall revenue. We collected data from existing customer relationship management (CRM) and sales systems. We created a forecasting model in Azure Databricks using existing and custom linear regression to process the collected data. To reduce forecast runtime and achieve near real-time analysis, we modified the existing R libraries to SparkR. The improved insight helped our client proactively focus on retailers with the highest sales impact.
We built a check-in app for one of our client’s most attended event. A multinational technology company organizes an annual multi-event internal expo attended by thousands of their employees. The manual process of tracking attendance, sending acknowledgments, and receiving feedback was time consuming. To automate the process, we built a check-in app that uses mobile devices’ camera to capture the identification badge of each participant. The captured images are stored in an Azure Blob. An Azure Logic App reads the image content utilizing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) API to update attendance records. After the event, notifications are sent to attendees via Microsoft Teams to complete a feedback survey using a Microsoft Power Automate Bot. The Feedback App reports the survey responses to determine the Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) score of the event.
For another client with high volume data, we developed and implemented a hybrid data processing solution using Azure Stream Analytics and Azure Databricks to reduce data refresh time from 3 hours to less than 30 minutes. We sourced data from the Azure Event Hub, where refreshes originate. Refreshes are captured through stream analytics and the updated data is pushed to Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS). The data is processed in ADLS, then pushed to Power BI for reporting.

As 2021 Microsoft Power BI Partner of the Year, we enable leading companies to accelerate their business intelligence and analytics initiatives. Our solutions enable our clients to improve their operations, reduce costs, increase sales, and build stronger customer relationships.
Our clients consistently recognize us for providing architecture and governance frameworks, implementing best practices to optimize reports, and building team capability through training programs. Our innovative tools and 33 certified visuals expand Power BI capabilities to save time for decision makers.
As a premier supplier to Microsoft for two decades, our clients benefit from our extensive insights on the platform and engineering practices. As a Microsoft Partner with 10 Gold competencies, our clients improve their implementations with our breadth and depth of expertise.
With globally integrated teams in Redmond, Washington, and Mumbai, Hyderabad, and NOIDA India, we deliver solutions with increased velocity and tech intensity.
Inc. magazine has recognized us for sustained growth by listing us on the Inc. 5000 list ten times – a rare honor.

Engineering culture
We foster a strong engineering culture with a can-do attitude. All our key managers come from excellent educational backgrounds and have significant experience growing a company and mentoring software engineers. Due to our smaller size, we adopt the latest technologies and computing trends ahead of the larger industry players. As a part of the company’s globally distributed engineering team, our engineers gain exposure to the latest software engineering practices and fast development cycles.
Our developers routinely work on challenging technical problems that utilize the latest technologies for fast-paced software delivery.

Examples of some of our projects:
We built a supervised machine learning model that forecasts the impact of retail sales on our client’s overall revenue. We collected data from existing customer relationship management (CRM) and sales systems. We created a forecasting model in Azure Databricks using existing and custom linear regression to process the collected data. To reduce forecast runtime and achieve near real-time analysis, we modified the existing R libraries to SparkR. The improved insight helped our client proactively focus on retailers with the highest sales impact.
We built a check-in app for one of our client’s most attended event. A multinational technology company organizes an annual multi-event internal expo attended by thousands of their employees. The manual process of tracking attendance, sending acknowledgments, and receiving feedback was time consuming. To automate the process, we built a check-in app that uses mobile devices’ camera to capture the identification badge of each participant. The captured images are stored in an Azure Blob. An Azure Logic App reads the image content utilizing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) API to update attendance records. After the event, notifications are sent to attendees via Microsoft Teams to complete a feedback survey using a Microsoft Power Automate Bot. The Feedback App reports the survey responses to determine the Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) score of the event.
For another client with high volume data, we developed and implemented a hybrid data processing solution using Azure Stream Analytics and Azure Databricks to reduce data refresh time from 3 hours to less than 30 minutes. We sourced data from the Azure Event Hub, where refreshes originate. Refreshes are captured through stream analytics and the updated data is pushed to Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS). The data is processed in ADLS, then pushed to Power BI for reporting.

Understand complex technical issues, discern impact, and be able to explain the situation to maximize clarity and drive resolution
Qualifications
4+ years experience as a product manager
Experience working on viral growth, referral programs, invite flows, guild mechanics, social commerce, or other sharing-based growth strategies

Our clients consistently recognize us for providing architecture and governance frameworks, implementing best practices to optimize reports, and building team capability through training programs. Our innovative tools and 33 certified visuals expand Power BI capabilities to save time for decision makers.
As a premier supplier to Microsoft for two decades, our clients benefit from our extensive insights on the platform and engineering practices. As a Microsoft Partner with 10 Gold competencies, our clients improve their implementations with our breadth and depth of expertise.
With globally integrated teams in Redmond, Washington, and Mumbai, Hyderabad, and NOIDA India, we deliver solutions with increased velocity and tech intensity.
Inc. magazine has recognized us for sustained growth by listing us on the Inc. 5000 list ten times – a rare honor.

Engineering culture
We foster a strong engineering culture with a can-do attitude. All our key managers come from excellent educational backgrounds and have significant experience growing a company and mentoring software engineers. Due to our smaller size, we adopt the latest technologies and computing trends ahead of the larger industry players. As a part of the company’s globally distributed engineering team, our engineers gain exposure to the latest software engineering practices and fast development cycles.
Our developers routinely work on challenging technical problems that utilize the latest technologies for fast-paced software delivery.

Examples of some of our projects:
We built a supervised machine learning model that forecasts the impact of retail sales on our client’s overall revenue. We collected data from existing customer relationship management (CRM) and sales systems. We created a forecasting model in Azure Databricks using existing and custom linear regression to process the collected data. To reduce forecast runtime and achieve near real-time analysis, we modified the existing R libraries to SparkR. The improved insight helped our client proactively focus on retailers with the highest sales impact.
We built a check-in app for one of our client’s most attended event. A multinational technology company organizes an annual multi-event internal expo attended by thousands of their employees. The manual process of tracking attendance, sending acknowledgments, and receiving feedback was time consuming. To automate the process, we built a check-in app that uses mobile devices’ camera to capture the identification badge of each participant. The captured images are stored in an Azure Blob. An Azure Logic App reads the image content utilizing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) API to update attendance records. After the event, notifications are sent to attendees via Microsoft Teams to complete a feedback survey using a Microsoft Power Automate Bot. The Feedback App reports the survey responses to determine the Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) score of the event.
For another client with high volume data, we developed and implemented a hybrid data processing solution using Azure Stream Analytics and Azure Databricks to reduce data refresh time from 3 hours to less than 30 minutes. We sourced data from the Azure Event Hub, where refreshes originate. Refreshes are captured through stream analytics and the updated data is pushed to Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS). The data is processed in ADLS, then pushed to Power BI for reporting.

As 2021 Microsoft Power BI Partner of the Year, we enable leading companies to accelerate their business intelligence and analytics initiatives. Our solutions enable our clients to improve their operations, reduce costs, increase sales, and build stronger customer relationships.
Our clients consistently recognize us for providing architecture and governance frameworks, implementing best practices to optimize reports, and building team capability through training programs. Our innovative tools and 33 certified visuals expand Power BI capabilities to save time for decision makers.
As a premier supplier to Microsoft for two decades, our clients benefit from our extensive insights on the platform and engineering practices. As a Microsoft Partner with 10 Gold competencies, our clients improve their implementations with our breadth and depth of expertise.
With globally integrated teams in Redmond, Washington, and Mumbai, Hyderabad, and NOIDA India, we deliver solutions with increased velocity and tech intensity.
Inc. magazine has recognized us for sustained growth by listing us on the Inc. 5000 list ten times – a rare honor.

Engineering culture
We foster a strong engineering culture with a can-do attitude. All our key managers come from excellent educational backgrounds and have significant experience growing a company and mentoring software engineers. Due to our smaller size, we adopt the latest technologies and computing trends ahead of the larger industry players. As a part of the company’s globally distributed engineering team, our engineers gain exposure to the latest software engineering practices and fast development cycles.
Our developers routinely work on challenging technical problems that utilize the latest technologies for fast-paced software delivery.

Examples of some of our projects:
We built a supervised machine learning model that forecasts the impact of retail sales on our client’s overall revenue. We collected data from existing customer relationship management (CRM) and sales systems. We created a forecasting model in Azure Databricks using existing and custom linear regression to process the collected data. To reduce forecast runtime and achieve near real-time analysis, we modified the existing R libraries to SparkR. The improved insight helped our client proactively focus on retailers with the highest sales impact.
We built a check-in app for one of our client’s most attended event. A multinational technology company organizes an annual multi-event internal expo attended by thousands of their employees. The manual process of tracking attendance, sending acknowledgments, and receiving feedback was time consuming. To automate the process, we built a check-in app that uses mobile devices’ camera to capture the identification badge of each participant. The captured images are stored in an Azure Blob. An Azure Logic App reads the image content utilizing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) API to update attendance records. After the event, notifications are sent to attendees via Microsoft Teams to complete a feedback survey using a Microsoft Power Automate Bot. The Feedback App reports the survey responses to determine the Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) score of the event.
For another client with high volume data, we developed and implemented a hybrid data processing solution using Azure Stream Analytics and Azure Databricks to reduce data refresh time from 3 hours to less than 30 minutes. We sourced data from the Azure Event Hub, where refreshes originate. Refreshes are captured through stream analytics and the updated data is pushed to Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS). The data is processed in ADLS, then pushed to Power BI for reporting.

GEOSPATIAL DATA ANALYST FOR WILDFIRE-FUEL TREATMENT OUTCOMES,seattle,"University of Washington
4.2","Seattle, WA",4.2,Employer Provided Salary:$6K - $6K,3.8,4.1,3.7,3.5,4.0,10000+ Employees,1861,"Benefits:
As a UW employee, you will enjoy generous benefits and work/life programs. For a complete description of our benefits for this position, please visit our website, click here.


As a UW employee, you have a unique opportunity to change lives on our campuses, in our state and around the world. UW employees offer their boundless energy, creative problem solving skills and dedication to build stronger minds and a healthier world.

UW faculty and staff also enjoy outstanding benefits, professional growth opportunities and unique resources in an environment noted for diversity, intellectual excitement, artistic pursuits and natural beauty.

The School of Environmental and Forest Sciences is looking for a Research Scientist/Engineer 3 to serve as Geospatial Data Analyst for Wildfire-Fuel Treatment Outcomes.

Large-scale severe wildfires are expected to become increasingly common throughout much of North America, necessitating scientific data to inform postfire management treatment options and outcomes. Forest managers need site-specific quantitative monitoring data to develop long-term adaptative restoration plans based on science.

We are seeking a Geospatial Data Analyst with expertise in fire modeling and remotely sensed data to support innovative wildfire research. The incumbent will work on a project to improve our understanding of the conditions under which fuel treatments produce desired socioecological outcomes when encountered by wildfire. The incumbent will join a team of postdoctoral scholars, federal scientists, and university faculty who will develop and refine a core, scalable methodology that leverages existing spatial datasets on landscape, fire, and fuel treatment characteristics. The research team will apply this methodology to observed wildfire-treatment encounters in different landscapes across the United States to produce empirical case studies of wildfire-treatment outcomes (WTO’s). Fuel treatments are intended to change fire behavior (e.g., reduced intensity, spread rate, or spotting potential) in the event of a wildfire.

The selected candidate will collaborate on research to evaluate in the Pacific Northwest the reduction of fire severity, successful containment of fire spread, reduction of impacts to homes and critical infrastructure. These three outcomes are connected to the three pillars of the National Cohesive Wildland Fire Management Strategy (“Cohesive Strategy”) of fire resilient landscapes, safe and effective wildfire response, and fire-adapted communities, respectively. The research takes advantage of the tremendous variation in landscape, fire, and treatment characteristics to conduct a set of natural experiments, taking a “big data” and remote sensing approach to learning from past fuel treatment activities. Such empirical, data-driven assessments of WTO’s are critical to inform process-based models of future treatment outcomes under a changing climate, to improve future treatment layout and design, to guide decision-making on incidents, and to improve adaptive management and monitoring of fuel treatment investments. The proposed research involves both place-based empirical case studies and methodological development; therefore, the incumbent will work with a postdoctoral scholar and collaborators to build a foundation for improving monitoring systems, rapidly assessing drivers of treatment effectiveness on landscapes of interest, and fostering collaborative learning with agency partners.

RESPONSIBILITIES:

Research

Incumbent will assemble, process, and analyze large remote sensing datasets (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel-2, MODIS) and spatial datasets (e.g., FACTs, FTEM, field data) of wildfires and operational fuel treatments using R/Python and Google Earth Engine. Selected candidate will use cartographic principles and conventions sufficient to create maps for external and internal use that display natural resource and socio-economic information and highlight particular analysis results.

The incumbent will use multi-analysis and machine-learning based integration of high-resolution satellite imagery, model generated data, and field data of wildfire-treatment outcomes.

Selected candidate will collaborate with the larger national research teams to develop and refine a core, scalable methodology that leverages existing spatial datasets on landscape, fire, and fuel treatment characteristics for large wildfires. The team will develop a process to apply methodologies to observed wildfire-treatment encounters in different landscapes across the United States to produce empirical case studies of wildfire-treatment outcomes.

To provide research support with statistical and geospatial analysis, wildland fire modeling, fuel and vegetation modeling, risk analysis, R or Python programming to research team.

To co-lead a field crew on establishment plots and collection of forest biometric data related to postfire stand conditions on selected recent wildfires where fuels have been treated in the Pacific Northwest in collaboration with a wide variety of federal, tribal, and state partners.

To collaborate closely with other team members located in other USFS Research Stations in the country. The research will be conducted in the laboratory and will require field visits to wildfire sites.


Project Management

To support principal investigators on project management and interface with a group of research scientists, federal cooperators, and contractors.

To maintain and document projects as necessary.

Incumbent will be responsible of gathering data, processing, and analyzing large remote sensing datasets and spatial datasets for wild-treatment outcome research. It includes analysis of spatial and related data (vector, raster, imagery) sufficient to support multi-scale and/or multi-resource planning, assessments, and monitoring.

Incumbent will lead a field crew on the second year on establishment and collection of wildfire-fuel treatment outcomes on large wildfires in the Pacific Northwest. Selected candidate will be responsible of ensuring that research protocols are followed during the execution, data entry and analysis of studies on fire and smoke hazards for federal, state, and tribal lands.

Supervisory responsibilities:

Works effectively as a member of a team under technical guidance of seasoned staff and collaborators; Incumbent will lead a seasonal field crew during the summer of the second year composed of students and technicians as necessary to achieve specific assignments.
