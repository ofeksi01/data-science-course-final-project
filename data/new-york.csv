OXMAN is a hybrid Design and R&D company that fuses design, technology, and biology to invent multi-scale products and environments. The fusion of disciplines within our work opens previously impossible opportunities within each domain—allowing design to inspire science and science to inspire design.

At OXMAN, we question dominant modes of design that have divorced us from Nature by prioritizing humanity above all else (human-centric design). Although it is design that has caused this rift, we believe that design also offers the greatest opportunity to heal it.

We propose a Nature-centric approach that delivers design solutions by, for, and with the natural world, while advancing humanity. In this pursuit, we reject all forms of segregation and instead call for a radical synergy between human-made and Nature-grown environments.

This approach demands that we design across scales for systems-level impact. We consider every designed construct a whole system of heterogeneous and complex interrelations—not isolated objects—that are intrinsically connected to their environments. In doing so, we open ourselves up to moving beyond the mere maintenance toward the advancement of Nature.

Summary

OXMAN is seeking a Machine Learning Engineer to join an all-star interdisciplinary team of deep thinkers and brilliant makers. In this position, they will contribute to database management, data analysis, machine learning architecture, modeling, and validation efforts in our organization. The primary focus is to design, optimize, and deploy machine learning pipelines using large multimodal datasets (i.e., tabular data, images, structured/unstructured text, time series, audio, biological sequences, etc.), containing heterogeneous and complex information related to biology, design, and sustainability. Experience with the design of traditional machine learning techniques and neural networks, along with a strong understanding of deep learning and the ability to build ML architectures for real-world use is desired. Successful applicants embody stellar technical skills, hold the capacity to navigate and resolve uncertainty, and demonstrate a unique “language” of biology (wetware) / computing (software) / fabricating (hardware), or a combination thereof. They have produced and can present a prolific corpus of research; exemplify a passion for systems-based thinking with a wide range of potential applications for their work; personify an appreciation for engineering, science, and art; and seek synergy between biology and technology in research, practice, and direct industrial utility.

The Machine Learning Engineer will play a key role in researching and developing novel algorithms, models, and methods for solving unique challenges of prediction/inference, knowledge search, and reinforcement learning within a variety of biological and bio-inspired systems—from single-celled organisms to whole ecologies and even biotic-abiotic hybrid systems, where autonomous robots may interact with biological organisms.

Core responsibilities
Lead efforts to aggregate and maintain selected multimodal datasets
Apply techniques from artificial intelligence and machine learning to develop, implement, and evaluate state-of-the-art algorithms for applications related to biology, sustainability, and environmental data
Develop machine learning models and detailed documentation to assess system performance
Develop scalable rules-based systems, classifiers, regressors, knowledge graphs, reinforcement learning systems, and other machine learning pipelines to support physical and digital projects within our organization
Conduct functional analysis, design trade studies, requirements allocation, and interface definition to translate team and client requirements into hardware and software specifications

5.0","New York, NY",5.0,Employer Provided Salary:$130K,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,1 to 50 Employees,Company - Private,"Over the last few decades, technological innovation has relied on democratizing some of its key ingredients: knowledge (open publishing platforms), algorithms (code repositories) and computing (cloud providers). However, the last key component, data, largely remains trapped behind barriers of regulation, privacy, schema standards and competitive risk. Enabling scalable access to data will unlock enormous value for both individual developers and companies. This has only been made possible in the last few years, through advances in manifold learning algorithms and privacy-preserving computing. See our blog for more details.

One of the most valuable kinds of data today is in the financial sector. Financial data plays a key role across many industry verticals. However, it has notoriously been locked behind regulatory barriers and a lack of format standards. Our end product is an API that makes financial transactions accessible to both humans and machine-learning models, in a scalable and privacy-preserving way.

We
- come from various fields - engineering, mathematics, physics and arts.
- are allergic to over-engineering.
- are anarchists at heart and like to hack around the status quo.
love playing board and video games.
- are radically honest and appreciate challenging one another, rather than giving out “pats on the back”. Yet, we can always rely on each other for support, feedback and results.
- are willing to learn and adapt quickly to new situations and requirements. Languages, frameworks, libraries, compilers, etc. are just tools for a job. A new problem might need a new tool. If it doesn’t exist yet, we will build it.
- have a sense of humor (well, we think we do).

As an early member of our data science team, you will help
- push the limits of what can be done with data.
- build the team and drive the direction of the company.
- shape our product and culture.
- experience the direct impact of what you build on hundreds of millions of people’s financial lives.

The following are required
- the tools: Python, Pandas / Polars, Matplotlib, sklearn, etc.
SQL and fundamental database operations.
- recognized open-source contributions and/or top performance in data competitions (Kaggle, Numerai, etc.).
fluency in statistics and probability.

Healthcare should work for patients, but it doesn't. In their time of need, they call down outdated insurance directories. Then wait on hold. Then wait weeks for the privilege of a visit. Then wait in a room solely designed for waiting. Then wait for a surprise bill. In any other consumer industry, the companies delivering such a poor customer experience would not survive. But in healthcare, patients lack market power. Which means they are expected to accept the unacceptable.

Zocdoc's mission is to give power to the patient. To do that, we've built the leading healthcare marketplace that makes it easy to find and book in-person or virtual care in all 50 states, across +200 specialties and +12k insurance plans. By giving patients the ability to see and choose, we give them power. In doing so, we can make healthcare work like every other consumer sector, where businesses compete for customers, not the other way around. In time, this will drive quality up and prices down.

You'll be successful in this role if you have…
Passion for technology and the ability to think critically about performance, scalability, and reliability of software
Implemented fast and efficient software solutions using object-oriented or functional languages. Some of the technologies we utilize are Python, React, Scala, C# and Node.js, however we are language agnostic

Lead customer-centric - customer leadership is the key. If a customer has a problem we don’t wait. We understand what customer needs and we tailor our services, products around the customer. It doesn’t mean that we let the customer lead us. It means that we think about the customer first

Have a growth mindset - we commit to results and growth. We are responsible for results, not for the activity or time spent. If we believe we can’t achieve a result or a job, it’s our duty to raise the voice, push back, explain what we suggest instead. We don’t see results as something static - ever. This means that our results and expectations are becoming more ambitious, quarter over quarter. We constantly evolve

Challenge, inspire, respect - we are the challenger in the marketplace. When working with each other - or with customers - we enjoy and desire to challenge each other. We listen, reflect, and respond. We aim to understand the point of view of the other party and if there is customer merit in the argument. When we challenge, we articulate our hypothesis clearly and provide data and evidence in our argumentation. We respect the time of our colleagues. We have a zero-tolerance towards discrimination of any kind. We respect the environment

Execute systematically - We recognize that the start-up journey will only be successful if we learn twice as much as others in half the time. For us, innovation also means continuous improvement in all fields. We think in systems when driving results, growth, and learnings

Act with urgency - We have a sense of urgency in everything we do - at all times. It’s deeply rooted in the belief that as an up-start, as a challenger, we need to drive value for our customers faster and better than anybody else in the marketplace.

Behind WBD’s vast portfolio of iconic content and beloved brands, are the storytellers bringing our characters to life, the creators bringing them to your living rooms and the dreamers creating what’s next…
From brilliant creatives, to technology trailblazers, across the globe, WBD offers career defining opportunities, thoughtfully curated benefits, and the tools to explore and grow into your best selves. Here you are supported, here you are celebrated, here you can thrive.
Every great story has a new beginning.
We're excited to announce that Discovery and WarnerMedia have combined to become Warner Bros. Discovery. We're a premier global media and entertainment company offering audiences the world's most differentiated and complete portfolio of content, brands and franchises across television, film, sports, news, streaming and gaming. Our mission is simple. To be the world's best storytellers with world-class products for consumers.
From brilliant creatives to technology trailblazers and beyond, join us as we step into the next chapter.
Warner Bros. Discovery's DTC technology and product organization sits at the intersection of tech, entertainment, and everyday utility. We are continuously leveraging new technology to build immersive and interactive viewing experiences. Our platform covers everything from search, content catalog, and video transcoding, to personalization, global subscriptions, and more. We are committed to delivering unique and quality user experiences, ranging from video streaming to applications across connected TV, mobile, web and consoles. As a pure tech organization, we are essential to Warner Bros. Discovery’s continued growth, building world-class streaming products from the ground-up for our iconic brands like HBO Max, Discovery Channel, CNN, Food Network, HGTV, Eurosport, MotorTrend, and many more.
About You:
We are looking for a passionate Software Engineer leader to build and scale the DTC global editorial and content experience services and tools for our new global streaming app, Max, as well as any future DTC streaming apps. As a leader directing this area, you are well-versed in frontend and backend tech stacks, tools, and services that power the video and content experiences for millions of users globally. You have the ability to think like a product lead who builds tools and distributed services that cater to the needs of our internal partners (editorial and merchandising, personalization, search, and content discovery feature teams) with an eye for automation, efficiency, and scale. You measure your team’s success based on adoption of your tools, services, and platforms and the customer experience features they enable. You are as comfortable with technical depth in this area as you are well-versed with the industry trends to ensure that our decisions are data-driven, and sound from both statistical and business perspectives. You formulate close cross-functional relationships and have strong communication skills to relay results and proposed changes to partners/stakeholders across product, UX design, and technology areas (data, machine learning, data science, and analytics). You have a strong ability to synthesize complex technical concepts and designs to non-tech audiences and, similarly, you can quickly understand and translate product requirements into technical solutions and designs.
Responsibilities:
Partner with the global DTC merchandising team to build and scale tools and services that automate a majority of the editorial workflows so that we can leverage their creative expertise for human-in-the-loop evaluation of our machine learning efforts
Build and experiment with various personalized frontend and backend content experiences and services
Work in close collaboration with data engineers, machine learning scientists/engineers, and product managers who lead search, personalization, and content experience flows on our DTC apps
Motivate, inspire and create a culture of experimentation and data-driven innovation while constantly striving to be an advocate for doing what is right for our customers
You understand a broad range of computer science concepts, and know how, when, and where to use them (and when not to). You can dive deep into a wide range of technical problems offering suggestions and feedback to your team. Your interest in computer science has not faded as you moved into a leadership role and you are still comfortable with technical details and contributing to technical solutions.
Your written and verbal communication skills are top notch. You can distill key points out of complex technical descriptions to share with non-technical stakeholders, adapting your language and style of communication depending on the audience. You communicate through data, dates, and facts using emotion judiciously to motivate and inspire.
You lead by example and do not consider yourself above individual contributor work. You are comfortable teaching best practices by showing people, not just telling people. Teams follow your lead because you are an inspirational leader, because you are right, and because you can show everyone high quality examples of your own work.
You have demonstrated that you can manage multiple teams, or an area of strategic importance and significant impact. You are able to work effectively through other managers reporting to you.
You influence teams and groups outside your wider organization with your deep insight, strategic thinking, and relationship management.
You have participated in strategic planning and demonstrated good judgment in setting and delivering against strategic goals for your team. You are able to drive outcomes using key performance indicator goals within your team rather than dictating specific deliverables.
You have demonstrated the ability to make great hiring decisions as is evidenced by the performance and growth of engineers and managers on your team, and you are able to retain and develop the best engineers and managers. You have mentored and managed other engineering managers successfully. Your team is capable and autonomous without your continuous oversight and decision making as a result of your coaching of your own managers.
Must have the legal right to work in the United States.
Requirements:
7+ years leading and managing a software development team (providing coaching, mentoring, setting goals, and recruiting talent).
Programming & domain experience on Web 2.0 applications using a contemporary JavaScript framework (e.g. Angular, React, jQuery). Experience leading OTT application-engineering teams a plus.

Prior experience working with content management system, search and personalization of digital products (especially media content) is a huge plus

However, the last key component, data, largely remains trapped behind barriers of regulation, privacy, schema standards and competitive risk. Enabling scalable access to data will unlock enormous value for both individual developers and companies. This has only been made possible in the last few years, through advances in manifold learning algorithms and privacy-preserving computing. See our blog for more details.

One of the most valuable kinds of data today is in the financial sector. Financial data plays a key role across many industry verticals. However, it has notoriously been locked behind regulatory barriers and a lack of format standards. Our end product is an API that makes financial transactions accessible to both humans and machine-learning models, in a scalable and privacy-preserving way.

We
- come from various fields - engineering, mathematics, physics and arts.
- are allergic to over-engineering.
- are anarchists at heart and like to hack around the status quo.

ABOUT THE MLOps TEAM:

The MLOps team is focused on providing the necessary infrastructure our data scientists and data engineers need to enable them to move from research to production with machine learning models faster, more safely, and with the highest of quality. In order to do that, we're building a platform that will provide a standardized set of frameworks and tools at every part of the machine learning development life cycle. This includes giving data scientists the ability to share features across every team and to provide tools to easily deploy, monitor and experiment with their models. On top of this we will also focus on reducing friction for data scientists to build and productionize their own models end to end.

ABOUT THE ROLE:
The Trade Desk Senior Software Engineers are best described as an end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in all aspects of product strategy – from designing, building, and delivering products for our clients.
We have dozens of individual, mission-focused teams working across a wide spectrum of technological challenges. You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and aptitude, to lead engineers that focus on building large-scale distributed systems coordinating thousands of servers in cloud and physical data centers around the world, petabyte-scale data challenges, machine learning, advanced visualizations, and interactive user interfaces – to name a few.
Senior Software Engineers contribute to more than our product – they help build up our team. Through a combination of mentoring and technical leadership of local teams, you will make others better and raise the bar for those around you.

WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR:
You are a strong communicator. You’re able to collaborate cross functionally with data scientists and root cause pain points in their workflow.
You have a passion for improving the efficiency of others. The work you will do in MLOps will have a big impact on both the data scientists and the data engineers in our organization.
Experience building large scale data pipelines with spark is a plus.
Experience building machine learning models is a plus.
You have a sustained track record of leading engineers with a wide range of experience, while also making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful software projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you & your team are doing.
You are a driver. You will be driving technical projects and providing leadership in a ground-breaking and fast-paced environment. This includes task planning and conducting code reviews, as well as individual code contribution.
You understand engineering fundamentals. At our scale, many off-the-shelf techniques and existing technologies (open source and enterprise) simply don't work.
You are able to work from first principles to evaluate solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.
You are a broadly skilled engineer, accustomed to developing web services. You have experience building always-on systems, working across a variety of technologies and service layers.
You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world’s largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.
You work with confidence and without ego. Our engineers have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.
You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.
You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done"". What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need engineers who know all the answers; we need engineers who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.

Welcome to Warner Bros. Discovery… the stuff dreams are made of.
Who We Are…
When we say, “the stuff dreams are made of,” we’re not just referring to the world of wizards, dragons and superheroes, or even to the wonders of Planet Earth. Behind WBD’s vast portfolio of iconic content and beloved brands, are the storytellers bringing our characters to life, the creators bringing them to your living rooms and the dreamers creating what’s next…
From brilliant creatives, to technology trailblazers, across the globe, WBD offers career defining opportunities, thoughtfully curated benefits, and the tools to explore and grow into your best selves. Here you are supported, here you are celebrated, here you can thrive.
Every great story has a new beginning.
We're excited to announce that Discovery and WarnerMedia have combined to become Warner Bros. Discovery. We're a premier global media and entertainment company offering audiences the world's most differentiated and complete portfolio of content, brands and franchises across television, film, sports, news, streaming and gaming. Our mission is simple. To be the world's best storytellers with world-class products for consumers.
From brilliant creatives to technology trailblazers and beyond, join us as we step into the next chapter.
Warner Bros. Discovery's DTC technology and product organization sits at the intersection of tech, entertainment, and everyday utility. We are continuously leveraging new technology to build immersive and interactive viewing experiences. Our platform covers everything from search, content catalog, and video transcoding, to personalization, global subscriptions, and more. We are committed to delivering unique and quality user experiences, ranging from video streaming to applications across connected TV, mobile, web and consoles. As a pure tech organization, we are essential to Warner Bros. Discovery’s continued growth, building world-class streaming products from the ground-up for our iconic brands like HBO Max, Discovery Channel, CNN, Food Network, HGTV, Eurosport, MotorTrend, and many more.
About You:
We are looking for a passionate Software Engineer leader to build and scale the DTC global editorial and content experience services and tools for our new global streaming app, Max, as well as any future DTC streaming apps. As a leader directing this area, you are well-versed in frontend and backend tech stacks, tools, and services that power the video and content experiences for millions of users globally. You have the ability to think like a product lead who builds tools and distributed services that cater to the needs of our internal partners (editorial and merchandising, personalization, search, and content discovery feature teams) with an eye for automation, efficiency, and scale. You measure your team’s success based on adoption of your tools, services, and platforms and the customer experience features they enable. You are as comfortable with technical depth in this area as you are well-versed with the industry trends to ensure that our decisions are data-driven, and sound from both statistical and business perspectives. You formulate close cross-functional relationships and have strong communication skills to relay results and proposed changes to partners/stakeholders across product, UX design, and technology areas (data, machine learning, data science, and analytics). You have a strong ability to synthesize complex technical concepts and designs to non-tech audiences and, similarly, you can quickly understand and translate product requirements into technical solutions and designs.
Responsibilities:
Partner with the global DTC merchandising team to build and scale tools and services that automate a majority of the editorial workflows so that we can leverage their creative expertise for human-in-the-loop evaluation of our machine learning efforts
Build and experiment with various personalized frontend and backend content experiences and services
Work in close collaboration with data engineers, machine learning scientists/engineers, and product managers who lead search, personalization, and content experience flows on our DTC apps
Motivate, inspire and create a culture of experimentation and data-driven innovation while constantly striving to be an advocate for doing what is right for our customers
You understand a broad range of computer science concepts, and know how, when, and where to use them (and when not to). You can dive deep into a wide range of technical problems offering suggestions and feedback to your team. Your interest in computer science has not faded as you moved into a leadership role and you are still comfortable with technical details and contributing to technical solutions.
Your written and verbal communication skills are top notch. You can distill key points out of complex technical descriptions to share with non-technical stakeholders, adapting your language and style of communication depending on the audience. You communicate through data, dates, and facts using emotion judiciously to motivate and inspire.
You lead by example and do not consider yourself above individual contributor work. You are comfortable teaching best practices by showing people, not just telling people. Teams follow your lead because you are an inspirational leader, because you are right, and because you can show everyone high quality examples of your own work.
You have demonstrated that you can manage multiple teams, or an area of strategic importance and significant impact. You are able to work effectively through other managers reporting to you.
You influence teams and groups outside your wider organization with your deep insight, strategic thinking, and relationship management.
You have participated in strategic planning and demonstrated good judgment in setting and delivering against strategic goals for your team. You are able to drive outcomes using key performance indicator goals within your team rather than dictating specific deliverables.
You have demonstrated the ability to make great hiring decisions as is evidenced by the performance and growth of engineers and managers on your team, and you are able to retain and develop the best engineers and managers. You have mentored and managed other engineering managers successfully. Your team is capable and autonomous without your continuous oversight and decision making as a result of your coaching of your own managers.
Must have the legal right to work in the United States.
Requirements:
7+ years leading and managing a software development team (providing coaching, mentoring, setting goals, and recruiting talent).
Programming & domain experience on Web 2.0 applications using a contemporary JavaScript framework (e.g. Angular, React, jQuery). Experience leading OTT application-engineering teams a plus.
Hands-on expertise in disparate full-stack technologies, typically ranging from front-end user interfaces through to back-end systems and all points in between.
5+ years of programming experience using Java, Python, JavaScript, Swift or other similar language
A bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering or equivalent work experience.
Knowledge of large-scale distributed application architecture, design, implementation and performance tuning.
Experience in modern DevOps/SRE practices such as CI/CD, performance monitoring & incident management
Excellent communication and collaborative skills
Prior experience partnering with engineers, product managers and technical program managers
Prior experience working with content management system, search and personalization of digital products (especially media content) is a huge plus

OXMAN is a hybrid Design and R&D company that fuses design, technology, and biology to invent multi-scale products and environments. The fusion of disciplines within our work opens previously impossible opportunities within each domain—allowing design to inspire science and science to inspire design.

At OXMAN, we question dominant modes of design that have divorced us from Nature by prioritizing humanity above all else (human-centric design). Although it is design that has caused this rift, we believe that design also offers the greatest opportunity to heal it.

We propose a Nature-centric approach that delivers design solutions by, for, and with the natural world, while advancing humanity. In this pursuit, we reject all forms of segregation and instead call for a radical synergy between human-made and Nature-grown environments.

This approach demands that we design across scales for systems-level impact. We consider every designed construct a whole system of heterogeneous and complex interrelations—not isolated objects—that are intrinsically connected to their environments. In doing so, we open ourselves up to moving beyond the mere maintenance toward the advancement of Nature.

Successful applicants embody stellar technical skills, hold the capacity to navigate and resolve uncertainty, and demonstrate a unique “language” of biology (wetware) / computing (software) / fabricating (hardware), or a combination thereof. They have produced and can present a prolific corpus of research; exemplify a passion for systems-based thinking with a wide range of potential applications for their work; personify an appreciation for engineering, science, and art; and seek synergy between biology and technology in research, practice, and direct industrial utility.

The Machine Learning Engineer will play a key role in researching and developing novel algorithms, models, and methods for solving unique challenges of prediction/inference, knowledge search, and reinforcement learning within a variety of biological and bio-inspired systems—from single-celled organisms to whole ecologies and even biotic-abiotic hybrid systems, where autonomous robots may interact with biological organisms.

OXMAN is a hybrid Design and R&D company that fuses design, technology, and biology to invent multi-scale products and environments. The fusion of disciplines within our work opens previously impossible opportunities within each domain—allowing design to inspire science and science to inspire design.

At OXMAN, we question dominant modes of design that have divorced us from Nature by prioritizing humanity above all else (human-centric design). Although it is design that has caused this rift, we believe that design also offers the greatest opportunity to heal it.

We propose a Nature-centric approach that delivers design solutions by, for, and with the natural world, while advancing humanity. In this pursuit, we reject all forms of segregation and instead call for a radical synergy between human-made and Nature-grown environments.

This approach demands that we design across scales for systems-level impact. We consider every designed construct a whole system of heterogeneous and complex interrelations—not isolated objects—that are intrinsically connected to their environments. In doing so, we open ourselves up to moving beyond the mere maintenance toward the advancement of Nature.

Summary

OXMAN is seeking a Machine Learning Engineer to join an all-star interdisciplinary team of deep thinkers and brilliant makers. In this position, they will contribute to database management, data analysis, machine learning architecture, modeling, and validation efforts in our organization. The primary focus is to design, optimize, and deploy machine learning pipelines using large multimodal datasets (i.e., tabular data, images, structured/unstructured text, time series, audio, biological sequences, etc.), containing heterogeneous and complex information related to biology, design, and sustainability. Experience with the design of traditional machine learning techniques and neural networks, along with a strong understanding of deep learning and the ability to build ML architectures for real-world use is desired. Successful applicants embody stellar technical skills, hold the capacity to navigate and resolve uncertainty, and demonstrate a unique “language” of biology (wetware) / computing (software) / fabricating (hardware), or a combination thereof. They have produced and can present a prolific corpus of research; exemplify a passion for systems-based thinking with a wide range of potential applications for their work; personify an appreciation for engineering, science, and art; and seek synergy between biology and technology in research, practice, and direct industrial utility.

The Machine Learning Engineer will play a key role in researching and developing novel algorithms, models, and methods for solving unique challenges of prediction/inference, knowledge search, and reinforcement learning within a variety of biological and bio-inspired systems—from single-celled organisms to whole ecologies and even biotic-abiotic hybrid systems, where autonomous robots may interact with biological organisms.

OXMAN is a hybrid Design and R&D company that fuses design, technology, and biology to invent multi-scale products and environments. The fusion of disciplines within our work opens previously impossible opportunities within each domain—allowing design to inspire science and science to inspire design.

At OXMAN, we question dominant modes of design that have divorced us from Nature by prioritizing humanity above all else (human-centric design). Although it is design that has caused this rift, we believe that design also offers the greatest opportunity to heal it.

We propose a Nature-centric approach that delivers design solutions by, for, and with the natural world, while advancing humanity. In this pursuit, we reject all forms of segregation and instead call for a radical synergy between human-made and Nature-grown environments.

This approach demands that we design across scales for systems-level impact. We consider every designed construct a whole system of heterogeneous and complex interrelations—not isolated objects—that are intrinsically connected to their environments. In doing so, we open ourselves up to moving beyond the mere maintenance toward the advancement of Nature.

Summary

OXMAN is seeking a Machine Learning Engineer to join an all-star interdisciplinary team of deep thinkers and brilliant makers. In this position, they will contribute to database management, data analysis, machine learning architecture, modeling, and validation efforts in our organization. The primary focus is to design, optimize, and deploy machine learning pipelines using large multimodal datasets (i.e., tabular data, images, structured/unstructured text, time series, audio, biological sequences, etc.), containing heterogeneous and complex information related to biology, design, and sustainability. Experience with the design of traditional machine learning techniques and neural networks, along with a strong understanding of deep learning and the ability to build ML architectures for real-world use is desired. Successful applicants embody stellar technical skills, hold the capacity to navigate and resolve uncertainty, and demonstrate a unique “language” of biology (wetware) / computing (software) / fabricating (hardware), or a combination thereof. They have produced and can present a prolific corpus of research; exemplify a passion for systems-based thinking with a wide range of potential applications for their work; personify an appreciation for engineering, science, and art; and seek synergy between biology and technology in research, practice, and direct industrial utility.

The Machine Learning Engineer will play a key role in researching and developing novel algorithms, models, and methods for solving unique challenges of prediction/inference, knowledge search, and reinforcement learning within a variety of biological and bio-inspired systems—from single-celled organisms to whole ecologies and even biotic-abiotic hybrid systems, where autonomous robots may interact with biological organisms.

OXMAN is a hybrid Design and R&D company that fuses design, technology, and biology to invent multi-scale products and environments. The fusion of disciplines within our work opens previously impossible opportunities within each domain—allowing design to inspire science and science to inspire design.

At OXMAN, we question dominant modes of design that have divorced us from Nature by prioritizing humanity above all else (human-centric design). Although it is design that has caused this rift, we believe that design also offers the greatest opportunity to heal it.

We propose a Nature-centric approach that delivers design solutions by, for, and with the natural world, while advancing humanity. In this pursuit, we reject all forms of segregation and instead call for a radical synergy between human-made and Nature-grown environments.

This approach demands that we design across scales for systems-level impact. We consider every designed construct a whole system of heterogeneous and complex interrelations—not isolated objects—that are intrinsically connected to their environments. In doing so, we open ourselves up to moving beyond the mere maintenance toward the advancement of Nature.

Summary

OXMAN is seeking a Machine Learning Engineer to join an all-star interdisciplinary team of deep thinkers and brilliant makers. In this position, they will contribute to database management, data analysis, machine learning architecture, modeling, and validation efforts in our organization.

Experience with the design of traditional machine learning techniques and neural networks, along with a strong understanding of deep learning and the ability to build ML architectures for real-world use is desired. Successful applicants embody stellar technical skills, hold the capacity to navigate and resolve uncertainty, and demonstrate a unique “language” of biology (wetware) / computing (software) / fabricating (hardware), or a combination thereof. They have produced and can present a prolific corpus of research; exemplify a passion for systems-based thinking with a wide range of potential applications for their work; personify an appreciation for engineering, science, and art; and seek synergy between biology and technology in research, practice, and direct industrial utility.

The Machine Learning Engineer will play a key role in researching and developing novel algorithms, models, and methods for solving unique challenges of prediction/inference, knowledge search, and reinforcement learning within a variety of biological and bio-inspired systems—from single-celled organisms to whole ecologies and even biotic-abiotic hybrid systems, where autonomous robots may interact with biological organisms.

OXMAN is a hybrid Design and R&D company that fuses design, technology, and biology to invent multi-scale products and environments. The fusion of disciplines within our work opens previously impossible opportunities within each domain—allowing design to inspire science and science to inspire design.

At OXMAN, we question dominant modes of design that have divorced us from Nature by prioritizing humanity above all else (human-centric design). Although it is design that has caused this rift, we believe that design also offers the greatest opportunity to heal it.

We propose a Nature-centric approach that delivers design solutions by, for, and with the natural world, while advancing humanity. In this pursuit, we reject all forms of segregation and instead call for a radical synergy between human-made and Nature-grown environments.

This approach demands that we design across scales for systems-level impact. We consider every designed construct a whole system of heterogeneous and complex interrelations—not isolated objects—that are intrinsically connected to their environments. In doing so, we open ourselves up to moving beyond the mere maintenance toward the advancement of Nature.

Summary

OXMAN is seeking a Machine Learning Engineer to join an all-star interdisciplinary team of deep thinkers and brilliant makers. In this position, they will contribute to database management, data analysis, machine learning architecture, modeling, and validation efforts in our organization. The primary focus is to design, optimize, and deploy machine learning pipelines using large multimodal datasets (i.e., tabular data, images, structured/unstructured text, time series, audio, biological sequences, etc.), containing heterogeneous and complex information related to biology, design, and sustainability. Experience with the design of traditional machine learning techniques and neural networks, along with a strong understanding of deep learning and the ability to build ML architectures for real-world use is desired. Successful applicants embody stellar technical skills, hold the capacity to navigate and resolve uncertainty, and demonstrate a unique “language” of biology (wetware) / computing (software) / fabricating (hardware), or a combination thereof. They have produced and can present a prolific corpus of research; exemplify a passion for systems-based thinking with a wide range of potential applications for their work; personify an appreciation for engineering, science, and art; and seek synergy between biology and technology in research, practice, and direct industrial utility.

The Machine Learning Engineer will play a key role in researching and developing novel algorithms, models, and methods for solving unique challenges of prediction/inference, knowledge search, and reinforcement learning within a variety of biological and bio-inspired systems—from single-celled organisms to whole ecologies and even biotic-abiotic hybrid systems, where autonomous robots may interact with biological organisms.

OXMAN is a hybrid Design and R&D company that fuses design, technology, and biology to invent multi-scale products and environments. The fusion of disciplines within our work opens previously impossible opportunities within each domain—allowing design to inspire science and science to inspire design.

At OXMAN, we question dominant modes of design that have divorced us from Nature by prioritizing humanity above all else (human-centric design). Although it is design that has caused this rift, we believe that design also offers the greatest opportunity to heal it.

We propose a Nature-centric approach that delivers design solutions by, for, and with the natural world, while advancing humanity. In this pursuit, we reject all forms of segregation and instead call for a radical synergy between human-made and Nature-grown environments.

This approach demands that we design across scales for systems-level impact. We consider every designed construct a whole system of heterogeneous and complex interrelations—not isolated objects—that are intrinsically connected to their environments. In doing so, we open ourselves up to moving beyond the mere maintenance toward the advancement of Nature.

Summary

OXMAN is seeking a Machine Learning Engineer to join an all-star interdisciplinary team of deep thinkers and brilliant makers. In this position, they will contribute to database management, data analysis, machine learning architecture, modeling, and validation efforts in our organization. The primary focus is to design, optimize, and deploy machine learning pipelines using large multimodal datasets (i.e., tabular data, images, structured/unstructured text, time series, audio, biological sequences, etc.), containing heterogeneous and complex information related to biology, design, and sustainability. Experience with the design of traditional machine learning techniques and neural networks, along with a strong understanding of deep learning and the ability to build ML architectures for real-world use is desired.

OXMAN is a hybrid Design and R&D company that fuses design, technology, and biology to invent multi-scale products and environments. The fusion of disciplines within our work opens previously impossible opportunities within each domain—allowing design to inspire science and science to inspire design.

At OXMAN, we question dominant modes of design that have divorced us from Nature by prioritizing humanity above all else (human-centric design). Although it is design that has caused this rift, we believe that design also offers the greatest opportunity to heal it.

We propose a Nature-centric approach that delivers design solutions by, for, and with the natural world, while advancing humanity. In this pursuit, we reject all forms of segregation and instead call for a radical synergy between human-made and Nature-grown environments.

This approach demands that we design across scales for systems-level impact. We consider every designed construct a whole system of heterogeneous and complex interrelations—not isolated objects—that are intrinsically connected to their environments. In doing so, we open ourselves up to moving beyond the mere maintenance toward the advancement of Nature.

Summary

OXMAN is seeking a Machine Learning Engineer to join an all-star interdisciplinary team of deep thinkers and brilliant makers. In this position, they will contribute to database management, data analysis, machine learning architecture, modeling, and validation efforts in our organization. The primary focus is to design, optimize, and deploy machine learning pipelines using large multimodal datasets (i.e., tabular data, images, structured/unstructured text, time series, audio, biological sequences, etc.), containing heterogeneous and complex information related to biology, design, and sustainability. Experience with the design of traditional machine learning techniques and neural networks, along with a strong understanding of deep learning and the ability to build ML architectures for real-world use is desired. Successful applicants embody stellar technical skills, hold the capacity to navigate and resolve uncertainty, and demonstrate a unique “language” of biology (wetware) / computing (software) / fabricating (hardware), or a combination thereof. They have produced and can present a prolific corpus of research; exemplify a passion for systems-based thinking with a wide range of potential applications for their work; personify an appreciation for engineering, science, and art; and seek synergy between biology and technology in research, practice, and direct industrial utility.

The Machine Learning Engineer will play a key role in researching and developing novel algorithms, models, and methods for solving unique challenges of prediction/inference, knowledge search, and reinforcement learning within a variety of biological and bio-inspired systems—from single-celled organisms to whole ecologies and even biotic-abiotic hybrid systems, where autonomous robots may interact with biological organisms.

Lead efforts to aggregate and maintain selected multimodal datasets
Apply techniques from artificial intelligence and machine learning to develop, implement, and evaluate state-of-the-art algorithms for applications related to biology, sustainability, and environmental data

OXMAN is a hybrid Design and R&D company that fuses design, technology, and biology to invent multi-scale products and environments. The fusion of disciplines within our work opens previously impossible opportunities within each domain—allowing design to inspire science and science to inspire design.

At OXMAN, we question dominant modes of design that have divorced us from Nature by prioritizing humanity above all else (human-centric design). Although it is design that has caused this rift, we believe that design also offers the greatest opportunity to heal it.

We propose a Nature-centric approach that delivers design solutions by, for, and with the natural world, while advancing humanity. In this pursuit, we reject all forms of segregation and instead call for a radical synergy between human-made and Nature-grown environments.

This approach demands that we design across scales for systems-level impact. We consider every designed construct a whole system of heterogeneous and complex interrelations—not isolated objects—that are intrinsically connected to their environments. In doing so, we open ourselves up to moving beyond the mere maintenance toward the advancement of Nature.

Summary

OXMAN is seeking a Machine Learning Engineer to join an all-star interdisciplinary team of deep thinkers and brilliant makers. In this position, they will contribute to database management, data analysis, machine learning architecture, modeling, and validation efforts in our organization. The primary focus is to design, optimize, and deploy machine learning pipelines using large multimodal datasets (i.e., tabular data, images, structured/unstructured text, time series, audio, biological sequences, etc.), containing heterogeneous and complex information related to biology, design, and sustainability.

Machine Learning Engineer,new-york,OXMAN,"New York, NY",-1,Employer Provided Salary:$83K - $225K,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,1 to 50 Employees,Unknown,"OXMAN

OXMAN is a hybrid Design and R&D company that fuses design, technology, and biology to invent multi-scale products and environments. The fusion of disciplines within our work opens previously impossible opportunities within each domain—allowing design to inspire science and science to inspire design.

At OXMAN, we question dominant modes of design that have divorced us from Nature by prioritizing humanity above all else (human-centric design). Although it is design that has caused this rift, we believe that design also offers the greatest opportunity to heal it.

We propose a Nature-centric approach that delivers design solutions by, for, and with the natural world, while advancing humanity. In this pursuit, we reject all forms of segregation and instead call for a radical synergy between human-made and Nature-grown environments.

This approach demands that we design across scales for systems-level impact. We consider every designed construct a whole system of heterogeneous and complex interrelations—not isolated objects—that are intrinsically connected to their environments. In doing so, we open ourselves up to moving beyond the mere maintenance toward the advancement of Nature.

Summary

OXMAN is seeking a Machine Learning Engineer to join an all-star interdisciplinary team of deep thinkers and brilliant makers. In this position, they will contribute to database management, data analysis, machine learning architecture, modeling, and validation efforts in our organization. The primary focus is to design, optimize, and deploy machine learning pipelines using large multimodal datasets (i.e., tabular data, images, structured/unstructured text, time series, audio, biological sequences, etc.), containing heterogeneous and complex information related to biology, design, and sustainability. Experience with the design of traditional machine learning techniques and neural networks, along with a strong understanding of deep learning and the ability to build ML architectures for real-world use is desired. Successful applicants embody stellar technical skills, hold the capacity to navigate and resolve uncertainty, and demonstrate a unique “language” of biology (wetware) / computing (software) / fabricating (hardware), or a combination thereof. They have produced and can present a prolific corpus of research; exemplify a passion for systems-based thinking with a wide range of potential applications for their work; personify an appreciation for engineering, science, and art; and seek synergy between biology and technology in research, practice, and direct industrial utility.

The Machine Learning Engineer will play a key role in researching and developing novel algorithms, models, and methods for solving unique challenges of prediction/inference, knowledge search, and reinforcement learning within a variety of biological and bio-inspired systems—from single-celled organisms to whole ecologies and even biotic-abiotic hybrid systems, where autonomous robots may interact with biological organisms.

Core responsibilities
Lead efforts to aggregate and maintain selected multimodal datasets
Apply techniques from artificial intelligence and machine learning to develop, implement, and evaluate state-of-the-art algorithms for applications related to biology, sustainability, and environmental data
Develop machine learning models and detailed documentation to assess system performance
Develop scalable rules-based systems, classifiers, regressors, knowledge graphs, reinforcement learning systems, and other machine learning pipelines to support physical and digital projects within our organization
Conduct functional analysis, design trade studies, requirements allocation, and interface definition to translate team and client requirements into hardware and software specifications
Actively seek opportunities to publish work in top-tier journals and other platforms for diffusing scientific knowledge
Nurture and augment the scientific vision of OXMAN, upholding core design principles and ensuring the highest and most innovative quality of work
Actively partner with a multidisciplinary team of professionals, including other biologists, engineers, and designers, across scientific and design pursuits

OXMAN is a hybrid Design and R&D company that fuses design, technology, and biology to invent multi-scale products and environments. The fusion of disciplines within our work opens previously impossible opportunities within each domain—allowing design to inspire science and science to inspire design.

At OXMAN, we question dominant modes of design that have divorced us from Nature by prioritizing humanity above all else (human-centric design). Although it is design that has caused this rift, we believe that design also offers the greatest opportunity to heal it.

We propose a Nature-centric approach that delivers design solutions by, for, and with the natural world, while advancing humanity. In this pursuit, we reject all forms of segregation and instead call for a radical synergy between human-made and Nature-grown environments.

This approach demands that we design across scales for systems-level impact. We consider every designed construct a whole system of heterogeneous and complex interrelations—not isolated objects—that are intrinsically connected to their environments. In doing so, we open ourselves up to moving beyond the mere maintenance toward the advancement of Nature.

Summary

OXMAN is seeking a Machine Learning Engineer to join an all-star interdisciplinary team of deep thinkers and brilliant makers. In this position, they will contribute to database management, data analysis, machine learning architecture, modeling, and validation efforts in our organization. The primary focus is to design, optimize, and deploy machine learning pipelines using large multimodal datasets (i.e., tabular data, images, structured/unstructured text, time series, audio, biological sequences, etc.), containing heterogeneous and complex information related to biology, design, and sustainability. Experience with the design of traditional machine learning techniques and neural networks, along with a strong understanding of deep learning and the ability to build ML architectures for real-world use is desired. Successful applicants embody stellar technical skills, hold the capacity to navigate and resolve uncertainty, and demonstrate a unique “language” of biology (wetware) / computing (software) / fabricating (hardware), or a combination thereof. They have produced and can present a prolific corpus of research; exemplify a passion for systems-based thinking with a wide range of potential applications for their work; personify an appreciation for engineering, science, and art; and seek synergy between biology and technology in research, practice, and direct industrial utility.

The Machine Learning Engineer will play a key role in researching and developing novel algorithms, models, and methods for solving unique challenges of prediction/inference, knowledge search, and reinforcement learning within a variety of biological and bio-inspired systems—from single-celled organisms to whole ecologies and even biotic-abiotic hybrid systems, where autonomous robots may interact with biological organisms.

Core responsibilities
Lead efforts to aggregate and maintain selected multimodal datasets
Apply techniques from artificial intelligence and machine learning to develop, implement, and evaluate state-of-the-art algorithms for applications related to biology, sustainability, and environmental data
Develop machine learning models and detailed documentation to assess system performance
Develop scalable rules-based systems, classifiers, regressors, knowledge graphs, reinforcement learning systems, and other machine learning pipelines to support physical and digital projects within our organization
Conduct functional analysis, design trade studies, requirements allocation, and interface definition to translate team and client requirements into hardware and software specifications
Actively seek opportunities to publish work in top-tier journals and other platforms for diffusing scientific knowledge
Nurture and augment the scientific vision of OXMAN, upholding core design principles and ensuring the highest and most innovative quality of work
Actively partner with a multidisciplinary team of professionals, including other biologists, engineers, and designers, across scientific and design pursuits

OXMAN is a hybrid Design and R&D company that fuses design, technology, and biology to invent multi-scale products and environments. The fusion of disciplines within our work opens previously impossible opportunities within each domain—allowing design to inspire science and science to inspire design.

At OXMAN, we question dominant modes of design that have divorced us from Nature by prioritizing humanity above all else (human-centric design). Although it is design that has caused this rift, we believe that design also offers the greatest opportunity to heal it.

We propose a Nature-centric approach that delivers design solutions by, for, and with the natural world, while advancing humanity. In this pursuit, we reject all forms of segregation and instead call for a radical synergy between human-made and Nature-grown environments.

This approach demands that we design across scales for systems-level impact. We consider every designed construct a whole system of heterogeneous and complex interrelations—not isolated objects—that are intrinsically connected to their environments. In doing so, we open ourselves up to moving beyond the mere maintenance toward the advancement of Nature.

Summary

OXMAN is seeking a Machine Learning Engineer to join an all-star interdisciplinary team of deep thinkers and brilliant makers. In this position, they will contribute to database management, data analysis, machine learning architecture, modeling, and validation efforts in our organization. The primary focus is to design, optimize, and deploy machine learning pipelines using large multimodal datasets (i.e., tabular data, images, structured/unstructured text, time series, audio, biological sequences, etc.), containing heterogeneous and complex information related to biology, design, and sustainability. Experience with the design of traditional machine learning techniques and neural networks, along with a strong understanding of deep learning and the ability to build ML architectures for real-world use is desired. Successful applicants embody stellar technical skills, hold the capacity to navigate and resolve uncertainty, and demonstrate a unique “language” of biology (wetware) / computing (software) / fabricating (hardware), or a combination thereof. They have produced and can present a prolific corpus of research; exemplify a passion for systems-based thinking with a wide range of potential applications for their work; personify an appreciation for engineering, science, and art; and seek synergy between biology and technology in research, practice, and direct industrial utility.

The Machine Learning Engineer will play a key role in researching and developing novel algorithms, models, and methods for solving unique challenges of prediction/inference, knowledge search, and reinforcement learning within a variety of biological and bio-inspired systems—from single-celled organisms to whole ecologies and even biotic-abiotic hybrid systems, where autonomous robots may interact with biological organisms.

Core responsibilities
Lead efforts to aggregate and maintain selected multimodal datasets
Apply techniques from artificial intelligence and machine learning to develop, implement, and evaluate state-of-the-art algorithms for applications related to biology, sustainability, and environmental data
Develop machine learning models and detailed documentation to assess system performance
Develop scalable rules-based systems, classifiers, regressors, knowledge graphs, reinforcement learning systems, and other machine learning pipelines to support physical and digital projects within our organization
Conduct functional analysis, design trade studies, requirements allocation, and interface definition to translate team and client requirements into hardware and software specifications

OXMAN is a hybrid Design and R&D company that fuses design, technology, and biology to invent multi-scale products and environments. The fusion of disciplines within our work opens previously impossible opportunities within each domain—allowing design to inspire science and science to inspire design.

At OXMAN, we question dominant modes of design that have divorced us from Nature by prioritizing humanity above all else (human-centric design). Although it is design that has caused this rift, we believe that design also offers the greatest opportunity to heal it.

We propose a Nature-centric approach that delivers design solutions by, for, and with the natural world, while advancing humanity. In this pursuit, we reject all forms of segregation and instead call for a radical synergy between human-made and Nature-grown environments.

This approach demands that we design across scales for systems-level impact. We consider every designed construct a whole system of heterogeneous and complex interrelations—not isolated objects—that are intrinsically connected to their environments. In doing so, we open ourselves up to moving beyond the mere maintenance toward the advancement of Nature.

Summary

OXMAN is seeking a Machine Learning Engineer to join an all-star interdisciplinary team of deep thinkers and brilliant makers. In this position, they will contribute to database management, data analysis, machine learning architecture, modeling, and validation efforts in our organization. The primary focus is to design, optimize, and deploy machine learning pipelines using large multimodal datasets (i.e., tabular data, images, structured/unstructured text, time series, audio, biological sequences, etc.), containing heterogeneous and complex information related to biology, design, and sustainability. Experience with the design of traditional machine learning techniques and neural networks, along with a strong understanding of deep learning and the ability to build ML architectures for real-world use is desired. Successful applicants embody stellar technical skills, hold the capacity to navigate and resolve uncertainty, and demonstrate a unique “language” of biology (wetware) / computing (software) / fabricating (hardware), or a combination thereof. They have produced and can present a prolific corpus of research; exemplify a passion for systems-based thinking with a wide range of potential applications for their work; personify an appreciation for engineering, science, and art; and seek synergy between biology and technology in research, practice, and direct industrial utility.

The Machine Learning Engineer will play a key role in researching and developing novel algorithms, models, and methods for solving unique challenges of prediction/inference, knowledge search, and reinforcement learning within a variety of biological and bio-inspired systems—from single-celled organisms to whole ecologies and even biotic-abiotic hybrid systems, where autonomous robots may interact with biological organisms.

Core responsibilities
Lead efforts to aggregate and maintain selected multimodal datasets
Apply techniques from artificial intelligence and machine learning to develop, implement, and evaluate state-of-the-art algorithms for applications related to biology, sustainability, and environmental data
Develop machine learning models and detailed documentation to assess system performance
Develop scalable rules-based systems, classifiers, regressors, knowledge graphs, reinforcement learning systems, and other machine learning pipelines to support physical and digital projects within our organization
Conduct functional analysis, design trade studies, requirements allocation, and interface definition to translate team and client requirements into hardware and software specifications
Actively seek opportunities to publish work in top-tier journals and other platforms for diffusing scientific knowledge
Nurture and augment the scientific vision of OXMAN, upholding core design principles and ensuring the highest and most innovative quality of work
Actively partner with a multidisciplinary team of professionals, including other biologists, engineers, and designers, across scientific and design pursuits
